1246 so they say release early, and release often eh.
well okay, guess I'll release something then.
2252 tested the site on my phone earlier, it was a bit slow and
unresponsive, so I'll put up signs for when it is loading and
such ya
} 02 Jan 2015
0803 added blink tag via html5 css, for processing loading stuff
1610 so I'm thinking can add javascript translation support ya
can add a word formating thing, so compounds would be dot
seperated. 
also the verb would have to be distinguished, and the noun
phrases would have to be arguments. 
2323 we can either use an object which would allow named
arguments as input, or have them all in a set order. personally
I prefer named arguments, since it is more similar to how
natural languages are constructed. 
be say ob wu hello ya
say({ob:"hello"});
2326 say would have to be defined also
su say be function for tha ob word de
be console log ob word ya
function say(obj){
var word = obj[ob];
console.log(word);}
2330 so maybe plain ob would be standard argument, without
having an object. 
be say ob word de
be console log ob word ya
function say(word){
console.log(word);}
} 03 Jan 2015
0802 so I'm thinking it is more of a format thing than a
language thing. thus meaning we can output in mwak/eng/spa or
whatever other language, using the same format.
Though of course english is the international language of
computing, and many languages have different versions of say, so
it could make sense to have a dictionary for them also ya
0827 de is really like a multi-sentence quote, but for now we
can simply demonstrate some proof of concept javascript such as
with phrases and such
1428 the easiest computery output we can start with is JSON, can
have it as an output, and potentially even input language ya
also dicionary can be output in JSON. this will be at least a
minimal demonstration of it's programming language ability ya
2357 have it outputting the dictionary in JSON
} 05 Jan 2015
0559 added support for translation to json ya
1332 okay to add javascript output support,
we need to distinguish the verb ya
1336 okay made a verbWords array in grammar, can use that ya
1348 hmmm started making a javascript translation thingy,
but now I'm thinking how do we describe javascript as a
language?
it is prepositional, and it has : as phraseHeadJoiner
is has ';' as a period or end of sentence ya
has ',' as a phraseJoiner
phrases are also encapsulated with a '{' and '}' ya
word order is VO head initial
} 06 Jan 2015
0135 Anyways, should get back to the assigned roadmap ya
0157 have junctions in grammar, can work on junctionParse
then junction Object ya
0158 can start with firstJunctionWordIndexParse and
lastJunctionWordIndexParse.
0205 okay now we have two different kinds of junctions,
prepositional and postpositional style ya
the next stage is to identify phrase junctions,
but we want this to be modable, so can pass a parse function,
or else implement in the same level ya
0208 one possibility is to have a junction extract, much like
the quoteExtract, in it for instance anded phrases would be
grouped together, and extracted from the sentence.
we can check how quote extract works, though if I remember
correctly it simply returns an array with the quote in the same
place as it was, but in object form.
0211 junctions are slightly more complex, since they may be in
different parts of the sentence, though generally I think in
natural speech we find them in the same part of the sentence,
thus we can only accounts for those for now. 
0212 one way of having a modable junctionParse is that for
instance prepositional form would check if the word after it is
either a type or phrase word, if it is, then it gets that type,
and returns the result.
0214 okay lets try that for now
0214 for postpositional style, we'd have to get the next of
whatever it is ya
0220 oh actuall I guess postpositional stuff we usually parse
backwards anyways, so it's not as much of an issue, would still
be parsing whatever it is backwards ya
0227 wrote barebones algorithms for each
0259 implemented, now to test ya
0308 okay is working, now a junction object
0313 copied phrase.js to make junction.js
now rewriting the constructor algorithm
0317 wondering how this is going to work,
phrase encounters a junction at tail, 
then calls junction constructor with it's own head,
junction constructor would have to identify the head,
and parse accordingly, find the tail, and add matching heads 
to it's body ya
0321 later on the toString would iterate through body,
inserting the head junction until it reaches the end ya
0322 there is a hierarchy of junctions though, for instance and
is subordinate to or generally speaking ya
so perhaps would have to give what's been parsed thus far to
junction as an input, as it may be a phrase or a collection of
phrases ya
0325 alternatively it can figure out those things on it's own as
it's going through to be more consistent with other constructor
initialization ya
0326 anyways right now we are only looking at the simple case of
two phrases with one and in between ya
0331 change folder from type/ to class/ so easier to distinguish
from type.js
0352 wrote algorithsm for clause final and clause initial
junctions ya
0410 implementing
0423 hmm just realized that if I have a word junction in a
phrase.. well I guess the type getting will handle that. 
0438 okay wrote it
0442 it compiles
0455 anyways I'll finish debugging later, gotta catch some sleep.
1228 bah, Phrase seems to be acting weird now.
1231 Phrase gets confused if there is more than one of the same
type of phrase in the same sentence ya
while techincally it should simply get just one of them
1234 issue was I was using ta instead of tu, oops
1236 okay cool now simply have to do toString stuff
1237 just gotta prep lunch first ya
1338 good it works ya 
1339 now need it to work with prepositional or clause Initial
input ya
1359 hmmm it's not strict compliant, should fix that ya
1419 okay is strict compliant
1431 wrote the prepositional version
1447 okay working partially, but seems to break after third
1449 okay now both junctions work, have to add them to phrase
object ya
1507 okay seems to be working :-D
1511 next have to test in web version and then can release ya
} 07 Jan 2015
0451 time to test
0501 hmmm doesn't seem to work at sentence level ya
0512 it seems to be because only the parsed phrase tokens are
passed to new Phrase, wheras we'd need the ones previous in
order to get the junction out ya
however we relly on the parse function not including it ya
so we can either have another parse function ya
or find a way of passing the rest of the tokens to phrase ya
0516 I think an extra junction aware parsing function would be 
most compatible ya
0534 made parsing function, now debugging
0556 okay works for postpositional style ya
now for prepositional ya
0602 okay now to test it
0610 debugging
0617 okay it works :-)
0618 now web version ya
0622 seems to be having issue with topClause
0630 okay now got to put it back in order even with junctions ya
0639 okay fixed it up .ia ya
0646 excellent it works, can roadmap and git ya
} 08 Jan 2015
0316 so next is type junctions,
these might be a little bit easier as likely don't have to add
another parser function for them. Can simply have a junction
detector in the type class, which would forward the type
contents to Junction ya
0318 but ya, I'm a little sleepy, will continu this a bit later
2208 hmmm my latest calculations seem to indicate that hydrogen
is 249hz, resonant with B (246hz), helium is 214hz around
A(220hz), lithium is 164hz around E (164hz), berylium (196hz) 
G (195hz), boron 156hz D# (155hz), carbon (176hz) F(174hz), 
oxygen 193hz G (195hz), flourine 222hz A (220Hz). 
so what scale has, A B D# E F G
2226 well anyways that's pretty embarassing. 
I used the more usual f*l = c formula this time,
rather than the convoluted one I was using before. 
} 09 Jan 2015
0540 anyways time to do type junctions
0541 guess can start with the Junction class
0547 I'll check over the algorithm
0553 hmmm, seems like I will need a lastTypeIndexParse and
firstTypeIndexParse function, though should be easy enough.
0613 okay wrote lastTypeIndexParse, can test it ya
0634 okay firstTypeIndexParse also works,
now lets try Junction.
0647 hm seems to parsing correct, but not outputting properly.
appears to have lost it's prototypes.
0709 cool, so Junction level works now with string output ya
0710 now have to add it to Type object ya
0713 right should also check with English version ya
0727 okay fully debugged Junction and parsing,
think I need a nap before baby wakes ya
0815 okay works at Type level, now for Phrase level ya
0820 oh actually Type not yet fully operational ya
0827 issue with english multiple ands
0938 hmm, thinking now that have Type junctions, that case and
subphrase junctions are unecessary. however sentence and
subclause junctions can still be useful ya
1608 whatever can have all sorts and kinds why not, easy enough
to implement at this stage.
1642 okay turned out to be a parsing problem, has been fixed .ia
1645 works for Phrase, debugging for Sentence
1712 okay so test on web, then roadmap and git
1717 cool works, so roadmap and git
1752 found out yesterday that cytoskeletons resonate at
frequencies as low as 10Khz, that means we can make music which
appeals to them. Lets see, B
1756 so in western music that's the 9th octave,
or from about d#9 (9956Hz) til D#10 (19912Hz)
cytoskeleton music w00t w00t!
1806 okay found a study that mentions 2Khz til 20Khz
 http://www.rife.de/files/efficiency_of_solitary-waves.pdf 
1808 the diameter of a microtubule is 12nm and 24nm for inner
and outer, so lets see what note that gives us.
1816 op, redid my music calculations, seems I was right the
first time, it really is C# that is hydrogen harmonic. 
even with the f*l=c equation
(120 * (10^-12) * (16^13) * x) = 2.9979246E8 = approx. x = 554.72748
piano C# is 554.365 
1834 okay so F9 is closest to 11360Hz the harmonic of 
microtubule diameter, 31TET with A at 443.58Hz (tuned for
hydrogen) is -9Hz deviation, whereas 12TET is -184hz deviation.
1837 nice with this new A for 31, schuman is -0.079 deviation at
B2, wheras it's -0.113 for 12TEt, also B2.
1839 of course cytoskeleton microtubule wavelengths matter more
based on their lengths than their diameters, but it's something
ya, they all resonate by their diameters.
2111 decided will work on the translation in 0.4 since it is
more useful sooner. can do some real demonstrations once there
is enough vocabulary ya
} 11 Jan 2015
0411 made command like google translate script, with help of
translate-bin
0416 hmmm have to implement in javascript for portability ya
0421 seems google translate requires payment for apiKey,
so best to simply use translate-bin for now ya
we only need to translate the core words once ya
0438 so I'll have to implement the shell script output for
translation.
0537 for full implementation will need text append
otherwise the translation update script is almost complete 
0538 anyways need to catch some z's 
1539 I think I'm going to go back to posting some of my more
epic email responses on tumblr. They seem to be one of the most
popular sources of posts on reddit.
1623 so need to replace spaces with dashes in the output,
since sometimes a single word is equivalent to multiple words
in a foreign language ya
1624 also thinking insert would be a nice feature, since then
can insert the entry at same place as it is found in the
original file ya
1707 okay so have prett much completed single file translation,
can put the warnings in the .log file with the date
after that have to make a verification file, that makes sure
there aren't any double definition
} 12 Jan 2015
0459 have it working very well now, 
added arabic, portugeuse, now translating indonesian.
can probably also add german, japanese and korean ya
0503 hmmm gotta make yi take multiple words ya
0543 managed to fix the space problem by writing custom function
to replace the spaces with dashes ya
0614 thinking can translate to japanese and korean from chinese,
since then can only have to update chinese for the english
differences rather than all three.
0630 okay updated my mandarin file, will try doing translation
from it to japanese and korean
0643 okay so italian, dutch, swedish, adn then should be done
0717 okay well couldn't find a translation service for esperanto
but I think in total we have enough for now ya
0829 so next have to do roadmap and then verifiers
0904 apostrophe is more common than period for glottal stop so
we should change that ya
0943 some preliminary things I want to translate are some of
Aesop's fables, such as sour grapes. 
1212 thinking that using the apostrophe may make it more
difficult for some things as we'd have to use an escape sequence
for a lot of programs, especially for c conversion and the like. 
1216 there are apostrophe's in English though, so perhaps we can
try it and see if it works? I dono, it seems kinda scary, would
get all sorts of problems, and increase the size of things. I
also like how glottal stop periods are low just like in the 
throat. I think having it as an apostrophe is a bit confusing.
admitedly having it as a period is a bit confusing for people
which aren't familiar with it.
1222 anyways so roadmap done, lets git for now
oh also can make a tarball
2147 I'm going to have to write up a meeting draft soon,
so can probably translate that to mwak also,
it is pertinent to the political theme.
} 13 Jan 2015
0558 so gotta add grammar support for Arabic ya
I'll remove esperanto ya
0634 cool, gotta fix up a few arabic words
0635 then I want to add hindi :-D
oh and portugese, oh and indonesian if possible ya
0706 hmmm seems to be issue with end clasue for hindi and mwak
ya for instance hindi is getting the chinese end clause, and
mwak isn't getting any at all.
0728 okay fixed it, it was simply issue of having the cmnGrammar
in the hinLanguage by accident ya
0730 okay now portuguese ya
0736 next is indonesian, japanese, german, korean, turkish
vietnamese?, italian and swahili ya
0738 i'll add this to the roadmap ya
0743 of currently supported languages we have total support for
3.5 billion speakers (some maybe twice), once we add the above
we'll have 4.1 billion. 
1350 we should have UNL compatability layer sooner rather than
later, I should get UNL certified in order to do so adequately ya
1351 definitely before I start doing frame translations ya
1352 If we want this to be accepted by the UN, then
interoperability with the UNL is paramount!
1436 anyways for now can add a few more langs
can add danish, ukranian and hungarian to the list ya
1444 okay time to test indonesian
1458 okay fixed up vocab. next is Japanese.
1500 okay lets add a few langs at the same time 
jpn deu kor tur swa ukr swe nld
1857 k so they all work, sorta anyways,
since I want this to be used by the UN, I'll focus on the
official languages of the UN.
} 14 Jan 2015
1526 okay so git and roadmap
1527 now time for the verifier
1527 btw I found out that there is no "core UW" vocab
explicitly, the closest they have is extended basic english.
1528 so the frames we had before should be fine, 
though there may be UW attributes which are defined,
we can implement those for sure.
1528 oh an in terms of the syntax of the language I'd like to
fix up the glottal stops, and remove the diphthongs
1542 okay I also removed the unique phones restriction
1545 meh, actually I'll keep it for now
1546 got more than enough core vocab room to fill for now
1546 so I need a script to update the .u's and such to 'u's 
also to remove the CVV and CTVTV CTVV CVTV words,
easy enough for the latter, since can simply regenerate that
file, don't actually hve anything defined there.
1548 also I don't think I have anything defined in the X files,
yet anyways, so can remove those, and regenerate.
1549 oh actually I have nia and tai, and tua, blah
1550 guess I'll have to keep the diphthongs for now.
1551 so I'll just update the vocab files them
1604 okay updating to apostrophe notation, 
working out the kinks
} 15 Jan 2015
0253 great so we can include the UW attributes, and UW relations
which are already defined ya
0255 ideally I'd also support outputting them from my JSON,
or even inputting them, since we strive for UNL compatibility ya
Actually lets see what UNL already has so we don't overlap
functionality ya
0300 so currently they have LILY which is Language to
Interlingua to Language sYstem, which is also a pivot based
translator. It doesn't seem to aim to support computer
programming languages, and it doesn't seem to be functional yet
either. 
0425 anyways I managed to do CUPS250 but their whole way where
the focus on the subliminal meaning of stuff is really
frustrating cause it is so variable and hard to determine.
0427 anyways so I need to make a verifier.
0450 oh ya, I can also change the current diphthong cases to
monopthongs
0514 okay now just have to update the files
tua is now twa, tai is tya, kai is kya and nia is nya
0623 made the verification program, will have to weed out the
duplicated later as I need some shut eye before morning
0626 chinese needs the most work, and then to have japanese and
korean retranslate from it ya
1324 got a new monitor, it is a small one, 7 inches.
So can get a feel for what it would be like for BoP to program,
or how it can be done effectively anyways.
I have it standing up on the box it came in, so that my neck is
fully extended to look at it properly ya
su it be comfortable ya
su me be increase ob font size for ease of reading ya
} 16 Jan 2015
0536 figuring out how to have a core language, and one where we
translate out of. so finding pairs of which less prominent
languages usually use a source.
For instance swahili seems more commonly translated from Russian
than English. 
turkish is usually from arabic and french.
0630 so I'm currently debugging the non unique words out of the
dictionary ya
0712 great so I did it :-)
now they are all unique
0713 now to test the web version ya
0721 hmm seems to be working fine except the synesthesia ya
0723 okay fixed
1703 probably going to have to change back to periods instead of
apostrophes since periods are more compatible with URL's and
filenames. 
} 18 Jan 2015
0724 so next is verb, ergative and tripartite support.
verb support can be added by making a verb variable in grammar.
ergative, tripartive, nominal best with enum
1603 I was looking up x-bar theory, it was saying how a sentence
is like a phrase, with a head consisting of the tense and aspect
ya
So I can probably put tense and aspect in the mood area of the
sentence, which would then be the head of the sentence ya
want su me be sleep ya
past su me be eat ob buckwheat ya
recently su me be watch ob one piece ya
happy su me be like ob it ya
clarify flow su it ob tense and aspect 
in mood area of sentence ya 
} 19 Jan 2015
0258 so should also define object and subject for ergative
transformation ya
0326 did a little studying on tripartite, ergative and
nominative languages.
0327 gotta look up javascript enums if they are viable.
0329 hmmm seems like it would be somewhat of a hassle.
0330 thinking of changing meaning from subject to agent but I
guess it's moot right now, since subject is the more common SOV
and w/e.  I'm using "hu" as agent word. that way can have an
intransitive word order ya
0419 okay so wrote the intransitivity stuff now to test it
0437 okay debugged is working now :-)
0438 next is the long awaited performance grammar phrase
ordering ya
0454 hmmm so I guess it's an output thing,
in toLocaleString for sentence
0459 hmmm testing the word order stuff with indonesian, doesn't
seem to be quite right ya
0509 okay fixed, it was just a typo.
0529 so looked up performance grammar again, 
it seems to take most effect for clusters greater than 4 words.
the hungarian vso example I'm assuming is inflectional so really
has about that much if it were analytical.
0539 wrote algorithm, need some beauty sleep ya
0540 I'll assume by if it is twice the size of average length,
then it should be reordered by performance grammar
1424 so wheras SOV languages use time manner place,
SVO or head-initial languages use place manner time.
interesting so phrase order would change correspondingly.
1519 on the agenda is to finish up that blitz meeting and post
it project rejuvenation's wall.
} Jan 20 2015
0046 also have to make that translation pack so language
maintainers can more easily check on current and new
translations ya
0047 can probably set it up so that it emails them with new
definitions.
0050 anyways decided will do performance grammar in a simple way
for now, which is just to find the phrase which has a clause,
and set that in the tail and just return the rest to be
processed as normal ya.
0146 was studying up on China and it's great firewall,
also looking at my QQ profile, it's interesting.
Though I should really focus on the free world instead.
Chances are however upsetting that they don't want deliberative
assembly in China. Though it might be possible to be a business
thing or something *shrugs*.
Anyways it's a big market, but there is 6 billion other people
in the world also, which may be better to focus on, since they
aren't behind a firewall. 
0209 okay wrote in performance grammar for toLocaleString, now
to test ya
0234 okay it is working even in web version so can increment
roadmap and git
0243 so next is UW relations and toki pona level vocabulary

@zoomorphism (Applying animal characteristics to humans or gods)
0316 wow there are over 800 of those
0318 I think I like them more than the relations
they seem to cover the same kind of stuff but better,
also the relations are very confusing, since they are all about
graphs and not about language.
0319 can probably start with the super categories
att
animacy (ANIA)
aspect (ASPA)
degree (DEGA)
emotions (FEEL)
figure of speech (FIGA)
gender (GENA)
information structure (ISTA)
lexical category (LEXA)
manner (HOW)
modality (MODA)
nominal attributes (NOUA)
person (PERA)
place (WHERE)
polarity (POLA)
quantification (QUAA)
register (REGA)
social deixis (SODA)
specification (WHICH)
syntactic structures (SYNA)
time (WHEN)
voice (VOIA)
0321 some of those categories while interesting,
are far to specific for an initial frame vocabulary.
0332 I could probably use at least some of it though
perhaps can make a frame vocab that is intersection of one I
made before and this, that may be ideal ya
or can simply select the useful categories like person place
quantification and such
1016 okay what to do, I guess we can do some basic vocab words
for now ya
maybe funny so I can finally make that reply to that guy
can also check out the toki pona vocabulary
1021 hmmm guess can start with english lemmas,
those are bound to be useful, intersected with UW attributes.
I can change mi to be simply first person pronoun
yu to be second person pronoun
sa to be third person pronoun
mu to be plural modifier
1025 okay too many files, gotta trim it back down to the binary
ones 1 bit 2bit 3bit and 4 bit alphabet
or 2 glyphs 4 glyph 8glyph and 16glyph
can simply stop using the other ones
1027 in fact can simply use the 16 bit one and disregard the
others.
I wanted to change either to disjunct or something, 
or I can even simply remove all the 2bit definitions or
something dono, w/e leave them for now, we need to add words at
this point not remove.
1037 I tried putting the vocab in mwak performance grammar
order, but since from doesn't have official sublcauses it ends
up in the wrong spot, not fronted. thus I may have to shift some
stuff around for it to work properly ya
1107 okay rewrote algorithm for performance grammar will have to
debug
1149 almost works :-)
1201 okay works but need to figure out why kya is at end in
stead of front ya
1213 okay fixed
1231 now setting up so text outputs formated lines up to 64
glyphs long and breaks at nearest word boundary ya
} 21 Jan 2015
0024 changed my monitor to be be sideways, so is more like the
page of a book ya
has a good feel to it, also can see more history better this way
:-). 
0107 got a wordwrap function from internet, much better than
mine, but it has some extra newlines where I don't need, not
sure how to remove them, since it uses rather opaque regular
expression for matching.
0130 okay  I think I finally figured it out with a regexp
reference to help me :-)
needed lookahead patter (?=\\s|$) instead of normal match
0133 also performance grammar needs a bit more work
0137 okay now seems to be fully operational :-)
0144 should test in web version
0154 weird it isn't working in web version
0211 okay was issue with basis and not checking for clauses has
been fixed ya
0738 so what is next? vocabulary work.
guess I will start with UW relations and attributes,
even if the UNL implemenation of them is opaque,
at least the common ones which are easy to understand,
I will implement ya
0739 for now can add the UW or UNL equivalent to those words
which are already defined ya
1546 so I'm working on pronouns for now
1559 added null as nwa for 00 UW
1858 hmmm I don't think I should have plural and singular forms 
at this moment, there might be a bunch of other words that want
those CV spots ya, should just have a word for singulr and
plural ya
} 22 Jan 2015
0328 I guess singular is common enough, so I just took out the
one for plural and kept the generic yu 
0436 ya so I'm pretty much defining everything in 4bit, way too
much hassle trying to use multiple files ya
0439 put mom and  dad in the extended vocab, mam and pap ya
though I could put mother and father mat and pat in core
0616 changing yi to li so yi can be this, and ka can be it
0638 debugging seems to be some parse issue or something
0737 almost done update just have to debug a few non unique
words ya
1006 okay it is fully operational now :-)
2317 got synesthesia bookmarklet working fairly satisfactory now
:-D well only on desktop, have no idea how to get it to work on
a phone version, not sure how to open a bookmark in the same
window. 
} 23 Jan 2014
1231 okay figured it out. works on the phone for some websites
also anyways. 
1232 so planning on moving basic conjugation ahead on the
roadmap.
first will organize the language packs so they are in external
files, 
and then will do the conjugation ya
which will consist of simply removing or replace  the su ob ya 
yand and other unusual words ya
1302 okay so the first thing on the agenda is systemizing the
adding of new languages. 
1304 can use spelp as a model
1546 you know what I'm more interested in basic conjugation
support at this time, lets get a basic prototype working, to my
knowledge most languages don't have su and ob, so we can just
assume they aren't marked.
can have an unmarked phrase list ya
1632 or we can simply call it unmarked words.
hmmm I'm thinking topicalization can be good also,
since now that we have performance grammar subject isn't always
the first thing ya
1737 cool so got odroid working :-)
} 26 Jan 2015
0733 can do conjugation with regular expression search and
replace ya
a file consisting of su what to replace with ob what would be
sufficient also ya
0748 okay well seems like we would need multi word quote support
before can make conjugation from text files.  but for now can do
it with json files or something ya
0811 hmmm this form of conjugation is very basic, for instance
can't translate " of you " into "your" as that would require a
word-order change, but can translate "su you" into " ye ".
0813 I've also divided it into reversible and irreversible
conjugation ya
0814 wow, that's amazing I found a word for third-person
singular in english it is ey and eir for they and their
respectively :-D
1127 so can do Translate.conjugate(grammar.conjugation,string);
just before outputting, and this would be at the sentence level
ya
1141 can also deconjugate the reversible ones at least in
begining. 
1150 I've populated eng.js with a bunch of examples.
1402 also need it to take a variable for type of conjugation,
whether it is plain (none), conjugated (reversible), 
or naturalized (irreversible).
} 27 Jan 2014
0344 bah, time to get something done ya
0416 added the statements to sentence.js
0423 hmmm I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't accept any conjugation
as input, since there are no guarantees with such a brute for
search and replace..
0500 bah keep getting distracted by facebook :-|
0501 anyways so next have to set up spel-node.js to accept
eng.js as input, then write the conjugation search and replace
functions
0606 awesome conjugation is now fully operational
0625 still have to port other languages than english into the
new locale framework, and also test the web version. but can do
that later, need some more sleep first ya
1315 okay so I'm settin gup the file system for making it easier
to deal with the languages in locale
1327 okay I made french, now should test it
} 28 Jan 2015
0603 adding languages to the new directory system,
have english, french and spanish so far ya
0641 added mandardin, arabic, hindi
0652 added russian and ukranian
} 29 Jan 2015
0209 hopefully will have enough time to finish off basic
conjugation. or rather I guess we're working on systemizing now
ya
0211 one of the languages I'm most interested in is Inuktitut,
it requires some very heavy verb conjugation however.
also Esperanto requires conjugation, so it might make sense to
have a conjugation.verb and conjugation.noun function ya
0213 we can make a mwak flavoured version of Inuktitut, but it
will bear little or no resemblance to it's parent language ya
however it will still be easier to translate from that to
ordinary Inuktitut than simple SPEL.
Inuktitut is OSV the verbs are VS, it is verb-initial.
0232 I've also got to improve the performance of the site, since
it is too slow with the whole loading all these languages ya
perhaps can put the vocab in JSON files, or compact them into a
single file somehow, don't know if can require a JSON file thus
shove the dictionary in more easily.
0414 okay cool I finished systemizing, now I just have to update
the web file to use it.
0458 now I need to add the new langs ita and hun, also should
make a listener for the conjugation
0520 I have a feeling that if I publish a story in analytic
inuktitut some of the elder inuit might get rather angry ya
since it wouldn't really be inuktitut anymore ya
0530 weird it is not conjugating in web verrsion.
0533 maybe it needs a string buffer or something
0534 I dono anyways I need some sleep before dawn
0743 maybe it is because of static strings, might be able to get
around it with split join via stringBuffer ya
0910 I think it's because of the syntax highlighting, I have to
transform before the syntax highlighting.
0943 okay well now I have no idea why it's not working.
0942 also a simple regexp wouldn't work for anything with html
formatting
2203 finishing up first post to mailing list
} 30 Jan 2015
0714 so next is topicalization
2111 edited the roadmap some,
decided that should leave major conjugation ttil after 1.0 ya
} 31 Jan 2015
1438 updated git repository to reflect the new nodejs branch
it is called spel-code
} 01 Feb 2015
0154 set up my odroid, thinking of moving development over
there.
} 02 Feb 2015
1556 moved development to the odroid
2242 anyways I should really make that file translate thing
input of a language file and output of all files,
figures out language code by input parameter
figures out output language codes either default all,
or if all is given, or a list of particular ones.
loads only if language code given, and is not already defined.
2257 cool okay first one is working
2311 generified, now works for multiple langs,
need to make it even more streamlined, 
using an array or object of codes associated with variables. 
} 03 Feb 2015
0524 okay got it working, with the codes and all.
will have to update the spelp.js file and spel-node.js
accordingly also ya
0544 oh right so should make mwak a language like all the
others, so it could be loaded with them
0938 okay it seems to be all working smoothly together.
\
should update the spelp to work with the new system ASAP.
then we can probably call it a release. 
1004 updating spel-node.js
1019 okay updated :-)
later will have to accept spel-lang input can put it on roadmap
probably somewhere around javascript impelmentation
1033 updated japanese and chinese sentence final particles :-D
1052 updated spelp.js but gotta reinstall browserify
anywas g2g shopping for now will be back
1900 finished fixing it up 
} 04 Feb 2015
0629 so what's next on the roadmap? or rather, what next on the
roadmap do I most feel like implementing? I'm feeling
basic javascript would give me some good satisfaction around
now.
0631 so basic sentences into javascript, 
we'll be converting them into objects
su we be wil convert ob them into objectsixsx<F3>c4343
ya'b'uckwhneatcaleb 
{"su":"we","be":"wil convert","ob":"them","into":"objects"};
tat later su me be add ob verb support and subject support to it ya
me.add("it","verb support","subject support",{"tat":"later"});
su sentence tha be have ob nesting clause-tail ob also possible ya
sentence.have("nesting") = also_possible();
su 1 of item ob array-reference ya
item[1] mode "640x480 60Hz 32bit (GTF)"
    # PCLK: 23.86 MHz, H: 29.82 kHz, V: 60.00 Hz
    geometry 640 480 640 480 32
    timings 41918 80 16 13 1 64 3
    hsync low
    vsync high
endmodeat = arrayReference();
su mwak file contents ob tha be file-read of io ob mwak.txt ya
mwak_file_contents = io.fileRead("mwak.txt");
ob hey world be log of console ya
console.log("hey world")
ob hey world be say ya
say("hey world");
0712 anyways the basic part is just the first of those examples
0716 vocabulary note: 
want to change with to mwa, and love to something else maybe yam
0723 ay borean wen eurasiatic sun afroasiatic 
nikw sino-tibetan nam macro-khoisan
so definitely an n in there, probably an a also
wan or yan perhaps PIE has wenos also, so wan is okay
0732 okay wan it is
0958 thinking should do a glyph transform to romanize some of
the other phonetic scripts, like hindi, arabic and the native
one. like cree and inuktitut syllabics. 
1313 can put it on the roadmap after compound words
1420 trying to get IPA keyboard to work, is a hassle ya
1931 ya I seem obsessed with phonetic transcription 
ya it be on my mind constantly in recent hours
1932 specifically the transcription of English,
but also of the word compounding algorithms for mwak. 
1933 for mwak it is simple in case of consonants clusters
comprised of 1, 2 or 4 consonants,  but near impossible for 3,
so only 1, 2, 4 or 5 will be legal 5 only if the middle is an h
or a . so say a hypothetical may and kya need to go together,
instead of maykya it would be may.kya 
the h is for making meaningful compounds, that are meant as one
word. for instance  piy mak can be piyhmak  then equivalent to
wiyp
1940 for simplicity I can have an external file for the local
glyphs to IPA conversion, similar to the normal dictionary.
for instance the mwak one can be mwak.ipa.txt
just like the normal dictionary, a json would be generated, and
required. there would then be a ipa glyph translate function
available ya
1943 another thing on the todo list is to move cmn to zhe
since zhe wil have the pronunciation reform, and cmn can be
whatever the mandarin people speak
2055 can use web workers API to speed up multi language
translation. If there is more than a quarter second lag then
people may think it is slow, or unresponsive. 
it seems to take more than a second to show output on my samsung
s3 mini, which has a dual core processor, so there is room for
improvement. 
} 05 Feb 2015
0513 so verb highlighting ya can be done in toLocaleString for
sentence ya
0519 actually phrasal level may be better ya
0524 made initial code, now to test
0542 okay cool it works, now lets move subPhrase to type
0617 okay did preliminary code for moving subphrase to type
now lets test
0627 debugging
0653 wow it's all really broken now
0657 translation doesn't work, the dictionaries are blank.
0737 after I fix this, can make the json files dictionaries
instead of plain text for faster load times.
0758 okay may just have to roll it back
and try again or leave the subphrase stuff for later
0806 okay did a restore, may need to rewrite the verb stuff
0807 seems to have been saved so should be okay
moved genitives attaching to 0.5.D
0821 will need to retest the verb header stuff
1339 I discovered SystemC, it's pretty amazing stuff. 
basically like flow based programming, but implementable for
FPGA's.  not sure if it can be used as a general purpose
programming language, but if so then awesome :-D.
There is even some work getting it's simulators to work in
OpenCl.
1921 thinking about pronunciation reform again, can make the
definitions like in espeak, where the simpler ones go first, and
more complex ones later. I think a good goal would be to have
under 0x100 rules for pronunciation, this would mean it wouldn't
get too close to any current variant of english for instance,
and would stay relatively close to the spelling. 
0551 so next step is to add less popular languages from plain
text definitions
0608 wrote algorithm and code, now to test.
0637 okay the plain translator is working, now updated
translationUpdate to use it for esperanto.
0641 okay now to test ya
0705 okay it works :-D
1546 great so next is web workers! w00t w00t, I'm rather excited
to be adding web workers. 
1656 hmmm seems like workers and threads are only good for pure
functions. can't seem to process things as large as the language
translations without loading a bunch of stuff. I'm not even sure
how they can load it all hmmm.
1733 seems like workers are best for low level stuff with reduce
and map and such, I'll see if can adapt parallel.js to nodejs
environment portable with others.
1735 first off will have to optimize the hof.js stuff to work on
serially without performacne downgrade
2229 for the website generator, it can do translation on-the-fly
on-request, 
} 07 Feb 2015
1154 okay so no success setting up OpenCl on my headless system
either. There is a chance my Odroid might work with my old
monitor..
1158 anyways what is really necessary is for it to put in the
DOM that it is doing the translations ya
1243 fixing up device width media queries so it works in firefox
phones ya
1252 cool so works with my samsung galaxy s3 mini anyways
1717 attempting to translate back dictionary file 
which Igor verified for Russian.
1722 maybe my string-literals are broken, 
but in any case I am implementing word-quotes next so in some
ways this is good.
1722 seems like quote extract isn't working properly ya
2037 if I remember correctly the problem was with literal
parsing, where I prematurely attempted to make it grab multiple
words.
} 08 Feb 2015
0709 thinking about setTimeout, can probably use it with the
after-case i.e. after 4 seconds be say ob tha hello world ya
setTimeout(console.log("hello world"),4*1000);
the-word after could be used for other things also
after hello be say ob tha su me be love ob you ya
var hello=new Worker(
function(){
this.postMessage("complete"); });
hello.onmessage = (function(data){
if (event.data === "complete"){
say("su me be love ob you"); } }
0724 anyways  it's better than using a bunch of untranslatable
place-cases like in on through, which don't translate well,
i.e. in 40 seconds, in russian is through 40 seconds. 
but in both of them it is after 40 seconds. 
0725 the workers examples I just gave was  abit contrived,
could also just do
hello();
say("su me be love ob you");
0726 another thing we need is the whole _ like in that gnu
translation software. so it could be 
say(_("su me be love ob you"));
and then it would translate to the destination locale.
1238 I'm thinking it would be good to have a model client,
or rather customer. in order for the language to be useable we
need more vocabulary. I think we don't even have enough to reach
toki pona level, or that of some of the oligosynthetic languages
around. 
spirit guides say I should be the first customer, and should aim
to make all my communications in mwak. "this will the be fastest
route to progress".
" go ahead write a simple readme file with what you have already
assembled, can avoid literal quotes till you fix them. but at
least have an initial paragraph describing the project and it's
long term aims."
1249 looking at the quote parsing, it seems the first quote
parse only does type final quotes, and doesn't even check what
kind the grammar wants.
1250 hmmm seems like I'm going to have to write out algorithms
for most of the code, since I don't really understand how it is
supposed to work.
1303 okay edited the type class to be more sane, by parsing
typing before slicing tokens.
1307 k after word literals I'll do the readme
1450 hmmm seems pretty ruined now ya
1453 rolled back the changes to make it the way it was.
} 09 Feb 2015
0553 so will set it up theh readme to have speak able
programming language at the top, then do some more coding ya
0630 it has occured to me that english is actually verb initial
and noun final ya
0633 once I get the quote literals working, 
I want to set it up so that when there is a vocabulary update,
the new words are added to the log. and if there is a maintainer
for a language, then the new words are emailed to them for
review. also should do unique verify and send those results in
the same email ya
0723 okay so I'll probably set up this sending results sooner
rather than later, already got it to output all the required
stuff to the log.
1249 replied to thread on mwak-spel list ya
so definitely keeping the ya at the end for declarative
sentences ya
so can probably take off the list the ya initial from the
roadmap ya
1338 just gotta finish fixing up the output of translation
update, and we'll have the readme.
} 10 Feb 2015
0526 translated quote and such.
0542 okay so now gotta debug literals
I changed them to "li"s to make it easier to read them
0554 getting some kind of stack overflow range error :-S
problem is i don't know where it is happening.
0604 seems to be somewhere in the parsing, or something that
calls the parsing, anywas sleep for now.
0652 I'm thinking  of word for word quote, 
multi word quote can use tsi
I'm thinking word-quote will translate as the-word
just as glyph quote can be the-letter or the-glyph
and phoneme can be the-sound or the-phoneme
0659 so it crashes at creation of new type
goes on an infinite loop after
0720 okay found what it was, it is the junction stuff,
got to limit it to either tail word, or so that it checks for
literal quotes first
0742 expialadoshus! I finally did it :-D
1426 practicing some svg
1443 one thing I find quite annoying about it is the co-ordinate
system, which starts at top left instead of bottom left. 
} 11 Feb 2015
1237 okay so I'm thinking since quotes are a fairly rare
phenomena, we should dedicate one, at most 3 words to it. 
we have the word for literal, we can also have a word for
head-quote and tail-quote, 
for instance the head-quote work for mwak can be tsi 
not sure about tail quote just yet. 
so for instance tsi mak wi  would mean quoting word wi 
for multi word quotes could be  
quoting.sentence.su me be say ob hello ya.sentence.quoted
and for literals it would be 
literally quoting word wi 
short forms are possible such as 
li quo word wi 
and 
li quo.sentence. yo tsupalies .sentence.enquo
or since it's literal
li quo.s. yo hey tsup! .s.enquo
quo.li. yo hey tsup! .li.enquo
1244 in more pertinent matters there is a debate about question
words going on, so I have to add eh, and question to the vocab
promptly. 
1246 we'll start with question and then do eh
btw got to move the russian translation now that I completed it
1259 question
suʾāl Arabic. pātai Maori. wèntí Mandarin. swali Swahili. soru
Turkish. shitsumon Japanese. rogatio Latin. pergunta Spanish. 
vopros russian. kwestSun English. pertanian Indonesian. 
pṛkskā PIE.
okay so definitely s and a t, possibly a p initial, a vowel
psat  os swat, I guess the p for PIE. though the w is in
sino-tibetan, niger-congo and germanic. so lets go with swat.
p is Austric, and PIE, 
1310 okay now eh
na Arabic. em Russian, ha Finnish, Dutch, Icelandic. que
Spanish.  so velar fricative a nasal are most common.
since it is usually rising tone, maybe we can make it shi
it is shi ma in Mandarin.
1317 maybe I can allow affricate nasals, like cmi
though can simply make it  cyi like english ey
1319 though I guess questions are common enough it should be
okay to give it a two letter word. past tense isn't represented
in Mandarin yet it has a two letter word. 
1320 I was using bread as example so should include that in the
extended vocab.
bharsjom in PIE. ti? Afroasiatic. pen Proto-IE bread-food,
Bhereg Proto-IE ritual-bread. roti Malay. paraora Maori. xubz
Arabic. mianbao Mandarin. panis Latin. xleb Russian.
definitely p and n, vowel a, can double the p for X
panp
unless we figure out a technological use for bread,
then it can be in the core vocab, maybe bread boards kinda
thing. hmmm nah w/e panp is okay for now.
1327 I'm thinking can also change the from ksa to ca
1340 okay lets extract and translate
1356 need a word for enjoy
1405 okay gotta translate store also, or rather shop
also enjoy
1445 first shop
dukkan Arabic. parduotuvė Lithuanian. kedai Malay.
shāngdiàn Mandarin.  mise Japanese. dukan Hindi. duka Swahili.
taberna Latin. Laden German. dukkan Turkish. magazine Russian.
looks like tuk with maybe an n or an m of the maga
tumk maybe, or tsuk 
1647 may as well make a word for store also
shop can be sell-place, and store can be hold-place,
sklad Russian/Czech, lager Swedish, varasto Finnish.
2149 meh anyways lets finish what was decided on.
2202 thinking of just calling it tunk instead of tsuk
since that n is lots of plases also. 
eh, tunk kinda sounds like thunk,
tsuk sounds kinda shiny.
2212 I just realized even with two vowels, it's not obvious
where to split it, since a word can initiate with two
consonants. and end with wone, so kyatsuy is it kyat suy or kya
tsuy? thus would have to split it with a glottal stop also
kyat.suy or kya.tsuy  only four consonants in a row would be
possible to have together, tunktsi always becomes tunk tsi
tupsi is ambigious without a glottal stop.
so it may be best to keep the spaces. for now anyways
until we figure out a way around it. 
2218 might consider making the tenses three letter words later.
2219 oh right so enjoy, hmm no word for self
self
zìwǒ Mandarin. jiko Japanese. sam Russian. sarili Tagalog. 
sui idem Latin. Korean jasin. nafs Arabic. self English. HVNNV
Borean. kendi Turkish.
definitely s and n, possibly l, with an a
saln slan or san, maybe can appeal to slavs with sam, 
but hardly anyone uses it.
so enjoy could be psac since joy is pac. 
hmm pac is a weird choice for joy, since it doesn't have any
rperesentation from any modern used languages..
2235 lets edit joy then also
gaudium Latin. furaha Swahili. hars Hindi. radost Russian. haz
Turkish. huanxie Mandarin. orom Hungarian. inpam  Tamil. suk
Thai. gladje Swedish. alegria spanish. 
okay so definitiely k, vowel a, maybe m  or l and t or s
kam is begin, mak is word. 
klat like glad.  hmmm also it's probaly pay or something frot he
Borean BVJV, 
could also do klas like russian cool, maybe pas would integrate
a bunch of them. w/e lets keep pac.  and thus psac 
hmmm actually I guess it's get joy, not necessaril self joy,
which would be being happy with oneself
2252 okay so get is kat, so pack joy get
shop is a sell place. 
sell
parduoti Lithuanian. ba Arabic. mai Mandarin. uru Japanese. 
vender Spanish. menjual Malay. prodat Russian. palda Korean.
satmak Turkish.  sell English.
okay so p, a, t, l or m
palt like korean or plam maybe pamt or plat like russian pay
2303 how to say pay?
sumoketi Lithuanian. zhifu Mandarin. yadfau Arabic. platit
Russian. bezahlen German. pagar Spanish. odemek Turkish. jibul
Korean. solvo Latin. toleer Tuvan. membayar Indonesian. 
s, p, u, m or l 
sump sulp 
sulp
2313 I'm wondering if this that yonder should be root words
instead of grammar particles.. dono
2316 buy
yastari Arabic, pirkti Lithuanian. emo Latin. kaupa Old Norse. 
erosi Basque. comprar Portuguese, Spanish. gnel Armenian. 
mai Chinese.  pokupat Russian. kobe Danish. ostaa Finnish. 
membeli Indonesian. satin almak Turkish. 
k, p, u, m, t
2321 hmmm since it's supposed to be a language of business,
maybe buy sell trade pay should all be three letter words.
2326 sell put,  pay sup, buy kup
kup sup put
2332 trade
perdagangan Malay. maoyi Mandarin. prekyba Lithuanian. Handel
German. comercio Spanish. hudaldaa Mongolian. paanit Thai.
gyoyeok Korean. vartakamu Telugu. vyapar Hindi. sakhar Hebrew.
tijara Arabic. 
m or n, c, maybe k, commerical, commerce, 
kum cum
2338 I should also add Finnish, Hebrew, and Thai to the
available languages. 
2345
buy, sell, trade, kup put cum
or kut put kum
hmmm. kut is small
kup put kum
I like last variant best
} 12 Feb 2015
0008 anyways gotta go to sleep,
it's translating the new languages,
can add the grammar tommorrow. 
0619 added grammar
0652 I guess we can add the question sentences to roadmap
1247 hmmm I guess I could add topic fronting.
or rather wh fronting. 
1249 but that is more of a conjugation layer thing
1251 okay so moved javascript to be after quotes
1253 wh fronting is relevant to the current discussions though
1300 implementing wh fronting algorithm
1405 time to test it
1423 okay have debugged it :-) will add to roadmap
} 13 Feb 2015
0847 okay so wh fronting is done, can probably git and push.
also can probably make a tarball release.
on the mailing list the topic of topicalization has come up,
so may end up implementing that next. 
1240 okay so we can add in topic fronting, it's kind of a mix of
both of, and wh fronting algorithms, In that it can either take
a phrase or a type as it's argument. which will allow for
the double-subjects found in topic-prominent languages. 
1400 anyways I should look into topicalization
1446 gotta add some more vocab words, like topic
1447 wi and wa are currently taken
but before it was wa in japanese, it was fa, so we can use that.
originally it was pa, but that is currently taken by "that".
semantically it came from the word for water-wave. 
1454 okay so word for topic
mawdu Arabic. zhuti (juti) Mandarin. tema Spanish, Russian,
Hungarian, Japanese, Italian, ~German, ~Irish. 
topic English, Malay, ~Portuguese 
definitely tem or rather tam
2229 maybe
rubama Arabic. tabun Japanese. yexu Mandarin. yau honang
Cantonese.  naski Basque.  mungkin Malay. fortasse Latin. 
sayad Persian. aseyigi Cherokee. iindog Ojibwe. magadguj
Mongolian. amado Korean. peut-etre French. barangkali
Indonesian. kong ja Thai. moZet bit Russian. belki Turkish.
quiza Turkish. talvez Portuguese. 
Okay quite a bit of different ones there. 
probably n, k , t or p with u for that low sound
punk or tunk
probably punk
2242 oh, but if it is used for dubitative mood then..
pyu or tyu unlikely kyu, pyu
2240 can make the other one for possibly then instead of maybe
lots of m initials in maybe so maybe mya, it has that maybe feel
to it like meh-yeah m'ya 
} 14 Feb 2014
1209 started working on business plan, is available in doc/
folder.
will need to break it down so it just has 2-4 top level
sections. 
0 the playing field
1 the problem
2 the solution
3 the projections
2023 I'm thinking of putting it together with a story that links
it all together. the story will be of a prototypical customer in
the current market. 
2032 cool so apparently there are industry classification
systems, so may be able to pinpoint which industry it is, that
uses the constructed natural languages. 
in the
ISIC  (International Standard Industrial Classification)
7490 Other professional, scientific and technical activities
n.e.c
6201 Computer programming and related activities
8219 photocopying, document preparation
8549 Other Education n.e.c. -- language instruction
doesn't quite fit into either of those very well.
NAICS  (North American Industry Classification System)
611420 Computer Training: programming schools.
541930 Translation and Interpretation services.
541511 Custom Computer Programming Services.
561410 Document Preparation Services
2126 The best niche is probably 611420
since we'd be training people that could then provide
custom computer programming, document preparation and
translation.
} 15 Feb 2015
0313 had a dream Linus's wife offered me a year free room and
board if I at least attempted to latch the Linux kernel. When
asking how It could get in. she said that she is his wife, can
go around the usual channels.
0318 also had another dream where I was part of some prophecy,
somehow related to a young RMS like figure, but in the prophecy
Claus was saying it ws about making an unlimited quantity of
him, without the side-effects. 
in the same dream I had to jump into a pool, and do some deep
diving, ended up diving through solids and walking through
walls,
	could swim through the air, and peep out of walls. 
0321 anyways only patch I can imagine for the linux kernel
would either be of documentation, or of allowing compiling down
or from the C in which it is written. 
} 16 Feb 2015
0601 had a dream there was a conference or event showcasing
sexist and offensive terms in technology. 
Anyways, it's a good idea to remove them. 
such as abort, kill, man(ual)
can be replaced with stop and help
anyways this will be for the shell/OS level
0609 in terms of supportin g the linux kernel, and other similar
projects, the easiest would be as localization software. 
such as gettext.
most likely would simply complement gettext,
by translating the gettext files for other locales.
cool so there is even gettext for javascript and nodejs.
0620 oh right, so I also figured earlier that can implement
topic by adding the capacity of all phrases to compound,
cuz for reason,  time at now, that kinda stuff.
0627 so main thing to change is parsing and the phrase class 
} 17 Feb 2015
0412 got SystemC working, but still no luck with headless openCL
1305 thinking of making a startup called LibreChips,
which produces ASIC Chips based on OpenCores.
it would be a fabless company, that contracts out.
non-profit open business. 
First chip will fit the ATMega8 form factor 28P3,
and is meant to be drop in compatible with relevant arduino
boards. 
It will use OpenRISC instruction set though, so software wont be
compatible, but it's also a good point of diversity,
one reason we'll have to charge more than for ATMega's
All cores and data will be relicensed as GPL-3 if possible.
May have to rename it from OpenRISC to LibreRISC.
or LibreCPU OR with version number.
international non-profit open-business.
can write the business plan and docs in SPEL.
1631 to take advantage of extraordinarity bias,
can have a new picture on the chip for every press.
1658 okay so not sure how many charcters can fit,
lets assume maybe 8 or 16.
can use some emoji to liven it up, such as date of manufacture.
If it was released today it would be
🐸 🚪 LCCOR100🐎 ♒ 
frog being the manufacturer emoji
door meaning it's a gate ASIC,
LCC0R100 meaning LibreChip CPU OpenRISC 1.0.0
horse meaning it is year of horse, and aquarius for the
approximate month of manufacture.
Emoji characters take up two character widths it seems like.
In terms of the different ASIC types
Gate Array 	🚪	door 
Structured ASIC	🚧	construction-sign
Standard Cell	🌻	flower
Full Custom  	👚	clothing
FPGA		🚀	rocket
CPU		🏠	house
GPU		🏫	school
SoC		🏡	house with garden

🐸 🚪 LC🏠 OR10🐎 ♒
1735 to be honest it is kinda silly.
LC is a good acronym though.
Also only leaves 256 version numbers, assuming hexadecimal.
🐸 🚪 LC🏠 OR10🐎 ♒
in chinese:
蛤门LC居0R10馬♒
I guess emoji is more international.
🗽  statue of liberty could be libre chips
1808 anyways so I'll email OpenCores about my idea.
} 18 Feb 2015
0729 evidence
zhengu Mandarin. prueba Spanish. dokazatelstvo Russian. 
bukti Indonesian. evidencia Portuguese. preuve French. 
shoko Japanese. bisonyitek Hungarian. Saksya Sanskrit.
kor pisoot Thai.
0731 I have an idea, I can make a translation thing that just
translates a single word, so I'll be able to see what it looks
like in all the supported languages... Though for that would
also need it to translate from other scripts to IPA.
0735 proof
zhengu Mandarin. prueba Spanish. dokazatelstvo Russian. 
bukti Indonesian. prova Portuguese. preuve French. 
shoko Japanese. bisonyitek Hungarian. Saksya Sanskrit.
beweis German.  kor pisoot Thai.
definitely p, likely f or w, maybe k or t final, u vowel
pfuk 😲  or pfut
maybe pwuk, or pwut
evidentiality can be pwu or pfu 
or since there is the r can be pyuf and pyu
ya, pyuf sounds like proof
0823 it and this has been giving me lots of trouble in
translation, I'm thinking of perhaps removing one, 
replacing ka with that, and then pa will be free for topic.
1637 anyways should get topicalization done before the end of
the week. Also should order the odroid VU.
so we'll start the parser with postpositional mwak,
and then work on the prepositional version ya
} 19 Feb 2015
0506 there is one more thing I wanted to add,
which is wild cards for phrases, allowing new kinds of phrase
cases to be formed. maybe can make it wu.
oh may as well add in namely. 
0531 name
name English. ism Arabic. nomen Latin. nama Malay. vardas
Lithuanian. izen Basque. peyar Tamil. isim Turkish. /imja/
Russian. namae Japanese. ireum Korean. ming Mandarin. 
maybe nim or nism, nim
0544 so namely will be ni
0636 okay coded it for postpositional style.
0722 so debugged it also. now have to get the class to
incorporate it as head. 
1612 working on equivalences between Javascript, SystemC and
OpenCl, so can use the same paradigm for programming them all.
SystemC		OpenCl		Javascript
MODULE				
METHOD				worker	
sensitive	events?		worker.onMessage
THREADC				thread or clockEvent Worker	
1620 the datatypes are
void		void		undefined
bool		bool		true/false
uint		cl_uint		unsigned
int		cl_int		signed
		float		float
				double
1632 can check out SYCL also, it is the C++ version of OpenCl
1645 OpenKODE also looks interesting, it is a portability layer.
1852 hmmm looking into SYCL it seems very fascinating.
anyways lets see if I can finish the phrase class stuff.
1901 okay close, but have to resolve prepositional words
different from noun compound words for best results.
can do same for verb compound words while we are at it.
0656 can signal what kind of word it is via the highlighting
interface ya
0757 okay cool it is working.  I spent unduly long debugging it
while it was working because I thought the test case was
different than it was.
0802 okay now we simply need the prepositional parse and class
0821 okay coded for clause final prepositionals. gotta test
0958 cool so it is working. now just have to add topic fronting.
I'm thinking vocative fronting, then wh fronting, then topic
fronting. 
1000 for now topic fronting, can base it on whFronting
1011 so I was reading typing speed is necessary for programmer
productivity, so can make 40wpm a qualifier for people that want
stable part-time work. 
1021 okay topic fronting works, now vocative fronting.
1026 great it works :-D. only thing might be for hebrew, 
they have topics at the end instead of the begining.
guess can have variable of topicInitial in wordOrder
} 21 Feb 2015
0713 actually I'm not so sure about the hebrew stuff,
it might be just for the subject, and I don't wnat to go
througha bunch of hassle for an exception. 
they can always add it in later if they like.
0734 hmmm seems to be an input bug for word order
0737 guess I have to notify type if it is a noun or verb
it then has to notify word
0810 so can use from-source it seems what people like,
and also it is compatible with open source, linking to sources.
source
madSdar Arabic. gensen Japanese. chulcheo Korean. genyuan
Mandarin. saltinis Lithuanian. sumber Malay. source French.
origem Portuguese. istochnik Russian. bron Dutch. kalla swedish.
s, c, k, p?, m? n? u

0839 weird li error when trying to do vocabUpdate
1037 okay fixed it
1324 tree
TVNV  Borean. dhwanwos PIE.
sajar Arabic. shu Mandarin. 
1352 hmm I think wh fronting is lower priority than topic
1353 also if it is a subject-prominent language it should
subject-front.
1500 so I have to fix up word compound inputs, then can make
release. meanwhile need to translate the word have.
1505 have idea for MISC, 4 bit opcodes, 4 bit registers.
not sure how immediates or memory access would work though.
VSDO opV,rS,rD,rO  fits in 2  bytes. 
but maybe best to be like RISCV 4 byte opcodes, 32bit.
stop reinventing the wheel for the CPU, just the FPGA assembly.
I dono if there is an FPGA assembly. there is microcode, which
is similar, but it's not cross processor, so that would have to
be fixed up.  I like how RISCV is little endian :-D.
1511 have

} 22 Feb 2015
0644 so gotta add those compound input things.
0934 passed partOfSpeech information to type from phrase
yand from type to word yand rewrote algorithm for word ya
1536 talked to Inna about hebrew, she mentioned that hebrew
places the topics at the back of the sentence. so will have to
implement that. 
1837 been tuning the pseudo code to be like the future spel
code.
declaring input and output "ports" in the definition sentence.
} 23 Feb 2015
0704 okay, rewrote word, now to test
0724 debugging
0745 finished debugging :-D
1648 okay can post and then fix up the hebrew style topics.
1652 hmmm checking web version, having trouble with types that
have no body. 
1740 fixed
} 24 Feb 2014
0306 okay so gotta fix hebrew topics, subject prominence.
then can start working on quotes. 
also want to ask risc-v about a microcontroller version.
0322 also had minor topic issue where the topic word grabs the
contents of the phrase, have to restrict that to only if it is a
case. 
0332 added topic final and subject prominent
and fixed the topic grabbing stuff, will now test
0347 weird error where if simple topic phrase followed by
another phrase the contents of the simple topic phrase is lost.
0401 subject prominent fronting works. 
0420 the weird error seems limited to prepositional parsing
0426 okay fixed it I think.
0428 hmmmm now have to fix so the performance grammar doesn't
get in the way of postpositional topics
0438 okay seems pretty smooth, but clause-tail isn't marking
with the fronted cases. doesn't take into account the various
arrays and such.
0512 okay it seems to be working smoothly, will just check the
web version and then mark git release
0524 okay sleepy time
1254 okay so I'll slim down the roadmap to reduce scope bloat,
want to get to javascript translation ASAP.
1257 okay just three more things before javascript,
multi word quotes, multi sentence quotes,
and number quote endianness. 
1304 okay so it seems quote end-quote are what is usable
quote.logan. be happy .logan.end-quote
also Japanese comes to the rescue, with って (tte)
1310 it is used very similarly to that, being a postposition.
1326 okay so for literal quotes we'll use quote end-quote,
in the lojban zoi style. 
1330 and we'll do block quotes as per usual
be begin ob quote ya followed by be end ob quote ya
1331 I think block quotes are currently more important,
but multi word quotes are probably easier to implement,
can start with the parsing, then the quoteExtract would also
extract those. 
for block quotes would be a little more complicated, as a text
would have sub-texts. 
1333 number quote endianness is the easiest to implement.
maybe we can start with that. 
1432 little endian dozenal seems to be the best direction and
number base for mwak. we can symbolize any rational number with
the 12 consonants 0x0-0xB, 
m k y p w n s t l h f c
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B
decimal marker a 0xC, 
vinculum u 0xD, 
and negative i, 0xE
possible ., 0xF to show irrationality, or start/stop
.lkap or pi
hmm this kind of shows how big endian can be good,
since can more easily continue calculating pi with higher
precision, whereas with little endian have to pick a precision
and then count up.
I guess, addition, and multiplication are best done in little
endian, not sure about subtraction and division. 
1559 can use IEEE or similar style floating point numbers,
that way don't need a point. simply an exponent 
1945 superior highly composite fixed-point numbers
base 12 for  	4bit
base 120 for 	8bit
base 55440 for 	16bit
base 367567200 for 32bit
2251 I want to write a quick script, see how close I can
approximate, for instance pi by using these bases.

0118 based on these results among others, it is clear that even
though there may be some "waste", the higher SHCN numbers give
higher precision, and thus are worth using for fractional
representation.
they also neatly divide into each other so are easily
tranformed. for instance 55440 is 924 times larger than 60.
and 21621600 is 360360 times larger.
0131 also interesting to note is that their precision tends to
be equal to their length, so it is well worth while, binary
can't possibly give better precision, especially considering it
can't even render 1/3 or 1/5 succinctly.
so yeah, I guess if the base and exponent reflects the base used
in the fraction, then can have comprable range to IEEE floats.
0133 yeah, the range is comparable 60^3 is more than 2^14,
but 60^-3 is less than 2^-24
0139 infinity can be 63, NaN can be 60, 
0725 can make a program to test the completeness of the
representation in integerspace
0956 checked musical limits, 3,5,7,11,15
they are represented perfectly by SHCN,
3-limit by 6 and above		(SHCN8)
5-limit by 60 and above		(SHCN16)
7-limit by 2520 and above   	(SHCN32)
11-limit by 55440 and above	(SHCN64)
15-limit by 60 and above 	(SHCN16)
1101 Tonality Diamonds, a band on Mercury, or perhaps Venus.
More likely Venus, as they have good amount of atmosphere,
and enough stability to be enjoying the arts aplenty. 
1135 thinking of a simple emulator that can implement,
using three or four shorts.  1 short for fraction, 2 shorts for
precision, 1 short for exponents and signs.
1138 okay before I go ranting and raving about this,
should make an algorithm to test the thoroughness of
representation throughout it's range, for instance there may be
some holes that aren't represented after exponentiation. 
for SHCN64 though can have 25bit SHCN for fraction and precision. 
1221 25bit SHCN can represent 13-limit perfectly, 
so can play "The Fruit of Life".
1238 okay I should make a document or something, like an article
that I could publish about it. but anyways I wanted to make a
pizza analogy of large and small infinities.
say you have 2 people, and 1 pizza, 
each slice is 1/2 of the pizza,
pizza divided in half 1/(1/2) so there are 2 slices in total. 
now say we have 3 people and 1 pizza,
each slice is 1/3 of the pizza
pizza is split in (1/1/3) and there are 3 slices in total.
now say we have an infinite number of people,
each slice is 1/infinity or nothing of the pizza,
1/(1/infinity) = 1/0  = infinity. 
so there is a large infinity number of slices.
1251 the above numbers can all be represnted in  SHCN8
1252 something that definitely have to do, is figure out how to
do the floating point operations. 
if it is in the same base it is pretty easy.
lets figure out how to represent it in written form
0S 0E 0P 0F = 0
S sign, E exponent, P precision, F fraction
pi in SHCN8
0S 0E 3P 1F = 3.1666.. 	doz 3.2
golden in SHCN8
0S 0E 1P 4F = 1.66666 	doz 1.8
9 in SHCNB
0S 1E 4P 1F = 0.61666	doz 0.
1305 hmmm it seems confusing having both a precision and
fraction portion, maybe we can just have the fraction..
1306 so how about we try it with a 6bit fraction in SHCN8
1314 okay so can make it like in music theory,
i.e. the top fraction is increment over 1. 
hmmm having some trouble getting it to work in javascript,
it seems to be rounding to integer instead of using float.
1328 hmmm nope, seems best to keep precision and fraction
seperate.  so what's the algorithm for that?
can get something that fits in base for precision,
then put the rest into fraction.

1957 current SHCN algorithm is On possibly O^n, donno,
anywas I want to make one that is O(log(n)) or something...
basically start half way through base, compare to fraction,
if difference i negative go up spliting remaining base in half,
if positive go other way, until there is no gain in precision.
} 26 Feb 2015
0645 so can have SHCN fixed and floats, the fixed are easier to
compute with, and are better for precise calculation like for
finance.  whereas the floats could be good for representing very
large or very small values.  
anyways I've got to get back to more perinent stuff. 
0656 I'll just notify the libfixmath people as it is more their
domain.

1013 so I'm thinking website localization seems to be the most
viable business for SPEL. The software would be free, but
translating the current content out of Natural into SPEL variant
is where the money would be. Could also offer certification for
people to become official translators.
} 01 March 2015 
0143 after lots of encouraging from Justin and Igor, I've
decided to make some concept diagrams for SPEL. While UML is
currently the industry standard, I'm much more impressed by ISO
STEP and EXPRESS. Since it allows modeling without silly GUI's.
Well and it is an International Standard, which can also be used
for making products, including CAD, absolutely awesome stuff.
I don't know why it's not more famous. maybe ISO is charging
people to have access to the standard.. Dono, read it was
open-standard, but not sure. 
1248 EXPRESS has minimal support, and STEP is proprietary.
So I'll use Petri Nets, since they are mathematically
validatable.

0610 anyways enough with all this foolishness. time to finish
adding quotes so can make this into a real programming language. 
0715 okay wrote multiWordQuoteParse now to test.

0747 okay it works :-) ya now for adding it to quote extract
yand type class ya

0822 had to make firstMultiWordQuoteParse also. have to test it.
0834 debugging.
0844 having some trouble since index shifts at every slice.
need to find total address somehow.
0949 okay fixed,
0950 all that is left is adding it to type.js 
1151 working on the readme some more
} 03 March 2015
0710 so I need  type to recognize that it is a multi word quote,
and then process it as such, perhaps sending it to a quote
class. word order is preserved for the quoted portion.
0735 okay added
0744 now to test
0805 okay words for Type with mwak, needs some tuning for
english.
0808 okay works for type initial now also :-)
0809 does not work for Phrase will need to fix
1554 may be issue with quotesExtract
} 04 Mar 2015
0705 debugged quotesExtract, now to test with Phrase
0708 excellent it is working, now will test in web version.
0711 awesome it is working, I can put it on roadmap
0736 so I can probably make an illustration of the syntax tree,
and then post to mailing list about it.
} 05 Mar 2015
0645 I'll make the syntax tree for the readme and then send it
in for review to the mailin list.
} 06 Mar 2015
1200 finalized first version of info/readme.tex
} 07  Mar 2015
0155 trying to process request to translate to conjugated
English, not sure why it doesn't seem to be conjugating, will
have to check sources.

perhaps we should focus on cities over 1 million, but on the

0554 okay it compiles, I take nap
1306 time to test and debug
1338 debuging, will have to do subject matching later also,
or genitive matching... guess subject since it's easier,
we still have to fix genitives.. eventually
1342 added it to roadmap as 0.6.6
1401 okay debugged current version,
still have to add subject matching.
1442 hmmm thinking it might actually be easier than I thought to
add the genitive version, can simply grab the whole be phrase,
which will contain the of or genitive, then can match against
it instead of end word and seperately other stuff.
it allows for "anonymous subtexts", wheras the subject would
make them named subtexts
1510 installing project libre, maybe will help with project

and tasks and stuff, I don't need that, I have a roadmap.

i'll start with just making the named version support,
and then I'll add in support for the anonymous version.
okay put it on the roadmap. 
} 12 Mar 2015
0715 bah, I'm so upset with myself, spent all morning replying
to an email instead of writing code.
0740 wrote surroundingSentenceIndexParse
1459 okay time to rewrite the whole algorithm,
for the parsing instead of hacking away at it. 
1511 now looking at the new algorithm, I'm wondering if perhaps
it would make more sense to do subText parsing at the Text
level, since we actually would find it easier with the sentences
already well formed. 
some of these features would be good for the DB API, like the
phrase finding. 
1515 okay lets check out where it would be best to insert this
text extraction, I'm guessing after most of the rest is done, it
would be a higher level reorganization.
1522 have to write text algorithm for what is already taking
place
2306 okay so there is a sentences array, now what. 
I guess we can find the subordinate texts and splice them out.
replacing it with their Text object.
The hardest part here would be nested subordinate text objects. 
either we'd have to do deep recursion, or rely on the Texts to
check themselves upon instantiation. 
also if the first sentence is a start sentence, and has a
subject, then we can set the text title.
}  13 Mar 2015
0700 wrote code for setting title of Text from first sentence ya
0702 now to test
0711 okay that works
0715 how can we be faster than assembly? FPGA's ;-).
0753 wrote subordinateTextSplice
0754 now have to write subordinateTextIndexExtract
0803 rewriting the algorithm with available Text API
0808 rewrote algorithm ya
0825 hmmm in order to use Text stuff, I'd have to either make a
text, or  make functions which can access sentences directly.
0835 okay made a rawSentenceFindGet
0914 okay coded it, now debugging ya
1104 hmmm how are we going to do the vocab stuff,
I'm thinking if we do some small number per day, can reach a
sufficent number overall.  perhaps like 16 or 12 a day. 
there are 158 words at present, we need something like 4,096
in order to have enough for a working vocabulary. 
12glyph has room for roughly a thousand, and 16glyph core for
two thousand,  so can do the framenet vocab in there,
and then add in remaining oxford 3000 to extended 16 bit.
if we do 20 words a day, can get to two thousand in 3 months.
1143 okay in my vocab core I see ~900 words.
can translate by random sample, by shuffeling the words that I
will be doing, then taking top few out to do.  reshuffeling the
next day, translating next batch, and so on.
1513 if I do one word per 5 minutes, I can do 16 words in an
hour and 20 minutes.
anyways should finish testing the subordinate texts
1531 there is some infinite loop somewhere
1533 okay solved that but there is some other issues now.
i'll bike for some shopping and then fix it after.
2137 thinking of just doing programming and debuging in morning,
and after noon doing vocab work. kinda didn't realize how  much
is missing. also vocab work doesn't require much skill. anyways.
2141 while (conjunction)
dang Mandarin. bayanamaa Arabic. dum Latin. poka Russian. ken
Turkish. aida-ni Japanese. sementara Indonesia.
2146 hmmm, it would be more structured if I chose one from each
of the big families. and had them in order of those families.
PIE, Sino-Tibetan, Afro-asiatic, Niger-Congo, Austric, Altaic,
Turkic, Uralic
okay so lets try again
dum Latin. poka Russian. dang Mandarin. bayanamaa Arabic. wakati Swahili,
 sementara Indonesia.  aida ni Japanese. ken Turkish. mig
hungarian.
2202 okay so obviously it is taking too long, can make some
scripts which use google translate, and then translate to IPA,
perhaps using espeak, or a basic glyph to IPA thing.
hmmm mandarin would need espeak.
2208 also we need a good sample of Proto-Indo-European. Guess
can use the most common langs for it. English, Spanish, Hindi,
Russian. 
2213 I'm almost tempted to pull a lojban and just do it for the
top eight languages or so.. but then I'd be excluding
niger-congo. okay looking at list of PIE branches.
from earliest to newest
Greek, Hindi, Russian, English, Spanish, Irish
okay if we strip the low used ones,
Hindi, Russian, English, Spanish to represent PIE.
(Europe/America)
Mandarin for sino-tibetan, Japanese for Altaic (far East)
Arabic for afro-asiatic (middle-east)
Swahili for niger-congo (Africa)
Indonesian for Austric (oceania or south-east asia)
Turkish for Turkic (central-asia)
and uralic is too minor
2233 so how many is that? 10, guess that's a good number
okay lets set up a simple translate script for it.
} Mar 14 2015
0720 okay works, just need to work on the script to IPA thing,
have been having some trouble with espeak. but ya anyways back
to debugging.
0726 okay seems to be working, would test it more but not sure
how. okay so lets just call it done then.
0736 okay next is number quote endianness. or lets fix the
espeak for the evening ya
0817 prett much works, just need arabic espeak files, and to
redirect stderr from translate-bin so that it doesn't clutter 
the screen.
0827 so need japanese and arabic
1128 actually looking into it more, seems like Turkish should be
enough to represent Altaic, it is the oldest member of that
language family. Also Korean and Japonic are isolates, so are
divergent, wheras turkic has been in central asia a long time,
so is more likely to be true to it's roots. 
1132 means I only need to add support for arabic.
1216 okay it works :-D

0900 tin see, tap touch, 
1506 adding words, and definitions.
1513 hmmm rhotic sounds are so common, I'm thinking of changing
l to r. but maybe it is too late for that.. few languages have
the same kind of rhotic sounds, and it's a weak sound. few
people can pronounce a true rolling r if they weren't born into
a trill r language. 
1546 can check which words don't have definitions
2148 guess I can include hungarian for uralic, it's easy to do,
and the total land area does cover nearly as much as
austronesian languages. 
2217 the way I grok it, a tradition is a state machine.
} 16 Mar 2015
0637 so lets see what else is on the roadmap
0638 number quote endianness and continuous deployment tests.
0639 so can do endianness in type probably, need both input and
output ya eventually would be best to split it out into
subclasses or something ya
0729 okay coded it.  now have to test ya
0828 okay it is fully working, will now git update
0839 first there is weird bug with sub texts when trying to do
vocab update.
1139 fixed the one releated to yi's, but still one with li's
1148 okay seems fully fixed now
1217 testing translation
1517 okay finally is working smoothly, it was issue that there
was an empty definition.
1522 hmmm yand and while is the same thing it seems like.
1534 replaced yand kwi with while swi :-)
1603 okay reduced some duplicates by taking out some synonyms
will try adding some new words now.
1627 added become and force
} 17 Mar 2015
0726 so I looked up block chains, and it turns out it's just a
distributed database. then I looked up magnet links, and it
turns out they work with distributed hash tables. 
0728 force is mass * distance/time^2 or maybe push amount
0733 hmmm become sounds like an aspect, a little bit farther
along than inchoative. so probably should make it into a grammar
word. It can only be used as a verb anyways.
0742 anyways I should set up the deployment test since it's
morning, and leave the vocab work for the evening.
0743 in terms of the distributed databases and hash tables, can
keep in mind making something like that with SPEL/mwak, that way
can make a SPEL network. encryption would be optional.
optimization would be for scalability, speed, and redundancy.
0744 proof of work seems to be a major waste of time,
however it uses tests to verify something hard to make,
so it might be possible to use it for SPEL development,
the hardest part would be generating the deployment tests,
to check if the new program meets the requirements. 
0748 okay so how are we going to accomplish these deployment
tests. I'm thinking I can research how deployment tests are
done. test automation.
0751 so there can be the names in the entries of the hosts,
these hosts could have records, such as for stability and
bandwidth, they would hold and maintain the manifests of the
files. I guess they would be bittorrent trackers, but for whole
websites. 
so for instance someone requests a website, via the WYN proxy,
depending on settings, it can prioritize getting it from the
original site, or get a WYN archive copy. for sites stored
completely in the WYN archive it would be just from there. 
so simple case is getting it normally from http server,
and then storing a copy in the proxy with a time-to-live,
notifying the network of it's availability at this source.
if someone later wishes to use the network to get it
0822 people would get paid in cryptocoin for hosting sites,
there can be soem kind of stats for which sites are most often
requested from the network, i.e. too slow from the original
source, these would be prioritized for loading into network, as
people could get paid for them. 
1321 have to translate part of genesis 11:6 for an email
YLT 11:6
 and Jehovah saith, `Lo, the people [is] one, and one 
pronunciation [is] to them all, and this it hath dreamed 
of doing; and now, nothing is restrained from them of that 
which they have purposed to do.'
NASB 11:6
The Lord said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have 
[a]the same language. And this is what they began to do, 
and now nothing which they purpose to do will 
be [b]impossible for them.
SPEL B 11:6
look su the people ob one while su one language to them all ya
and about this su it be hold ob dream to make  
while now  su null be hold from them about tha su them be hold ob
purpose to make ya
1338 so we need dream, keep, hold, purpose
1339 btw I've decided to remove have in favour of hold ya
some langauges don't hold a word for have ya and some languages
use have as a grammatical structure for tense and aspect.
1341 guess we'll start with the others for now
hmm keep and hold is the same word in most languages. 
1551 be capable might be best as kip
} 18 Mar 2015
0750  I'm thinking of using Tape as a testing framework. 
0753 one issue i'm having with translating is the about clause
isn't closing properly
1148 okay I'm making the tests, have made for word, and now
working on for types. guess I should do compound words also
actually.
1203 hmmm need to debug foreign quote it seems.
1207 okay fixed
1223 great all the type tests work, now for the phrase tests ya
1240 issue with verb order input from english, will have to fix
that.
1323 okay fixed it :-)
} 19 Mar 2015
0525 I might need a deep compare function for sentences/phrases
etc. I have isLike, but that's not isEqual ya
I guess it is equal if it is both a subset and a superset ya
0543 anyways can implement that a bit later, right now I need to
work out the kinks from that babel translation ya
0556 it seems to be cropping last word from top clause input ya
i'll take a nap for now.
1314 k so I guess it's vocab time. can check to see what kind of
vocab need to translate for the javadoc and prioritize that.
1359 so lets try translating first clause of Utils.java
Class provides centralized access to configuration property 
file and few general utility methods, can play role of 
application context.

su class be provide ob main access 
to configuration property file and few general utility method 
while be capable ob tha be application context ya
2118 so I was thinking how can make cryptocurrency or librecoin
based on a joule, a unit of energy, 2^16 joules is about 15
nutritional calories, about the size of a small sushi, or about
0.18 cents of electricity if it is at 10 cents per kilowatt.
can also calculate how much ram/disk space that is used by an
algorithm, is worth, based on the life-expectancy of the
ram or disk and cost of it, the cost would be converted to
joules via the price per kilowatt.
} 29 Mar 2015
0712 will definitely need to have conjugation which modifies
noun for the verb phrase ya
0821 added phoneme counter to word translate
} 21 Mar 2015
0235 so still have a few kinks to work out, mostly with top
clauses it seems. 
0237 also not sure if utility should be in the top few thousand
words.  but I guess it's common enough for computing and
economics that it would be good to have.
0752 trying to work out the kinks, main ones being lack of
subclause term for about tha, and the odd dropping of last word
of topClause
0805 okay fixed the subordinate clause thing
0814 can't seem to identify where the other issue is, it might
be something that passes to parsing of clause
} 22 Mar 2015 
0715 okay I narrowed it down, seems to be the mood word isn't
being properly accounted for. 
0742 okay I fixed it, issue was an inaccurate slice.
0743 I'd also like to only allocate topics/vocatives if they
don't have a clause when clause-final, since otherwise 
it would be best to put them at back to avoid the nasty
clause-tail word. or we could make it less nasty, though I think
for topic it's not so important. especially in English anyways
1239 I think that might be just making more work for myself at
the moment, have to focus on getting it to work at an acceptable
level, not necessarily at an ideal level.
2225 hmmm the mood doesn't work if input from clause, will have
to fix.
2251 can replace ti with kwa and make ti it, then ka can be as
2256 or maybe I should use which instead of that.
tli for unquote, tyi for quote
} 23 Mar 2015
0713 attempting to fix the mood thing for clause initial
sentences ya
0719 okay fixed
0724 okay now we have too many clauseTerms
0733 hmmm newline between topClause's may be beneficial
0743 fixed the topic if it contains clause
0749 okay seems fully operational
0751 just need to update vocab and adjust grammar
0759 oh yea, and adjust/check web version
0805 on isn't in enough languages will have to remove it
0807 guess we'll keep na as numeral then
1104 drafting email of the updates
1321 have issue with junctions, probably not being processed
properly in performance grammar
1406 okay had to extract the topClause and append it.
1411 now main issue is that some of the longer phrases seem to
be outputting as verb when they are nouns.
1448 it seems to be issue when it is inputing for first time
2301 added a bunch of words, now sleepy time
0641 should finish debugging that junction stuff
0706 okay got the input working, now just need the output
working also.
afterwards I'll set up a test to make sure this stays working ya
0711 okay it works. now to set up the test
0720 hmmm there is mild inconsistency in the test results, so
I'll see if I can fix that.
0721 also if I could somehow change the english default to be
based on noun rather than verb, that would be ideal.
0733 okay seems to work that way now :-)
I'd like to also check the verb version, since it was showing
some inconsistencies.
0749 there is also a weird double space at end of verb junction,
but w/e will leave that for later. meanwhile managed to
reduplicate that verb word order issue.
0753 okay fixed that also :-D. now can write that email.
0758 even managed to track down that rogue space ya
2135 the dictionary function on the web version doesn't work.
2209 was thinking about sailing on venus.

} 25 Mar 2015
0524 unfortunately it seems that at is too ambigious in most
languages, so it is easier to use in, same in reference to on. 
by ambigious I mean that it collides with other words in various
languages. 
0541 hmmm of doesn't seem to be working right, I'll make it as
noun part of speech.
0557 anywas so next lets do the javascript stuff
0559 appear may be better than arrive ya
0603 there is problem with internet connection, a sign I should
get focused on the javascript translation, hmmm.
0604 simple sentences to javascript. 
so we'll start with phrases perhaps. 
they become objects, like hello world ya, 
becomes {"sla":"munt"};  k lets try to do it.
or perhaps can even start with words, munt becomes "munt"
so we need to have a javascript langauge code, maybe javs,
or node.. I could check online maybe. hmmm I don't see anything,
so probably have to go with javs.
hmmm actually js doens't seem taken. neither does mw, so maybe
can make mwak mw. w/e I went with javs, cause I dono maybe there
is some rogue code floating around somewhere. 
0623 okay made a noun conjugate function in the javs.js file
0644 partially working, okay pretty much working, will sleep on
it.
1814 Arimatego, a hybrid of Arimma, Stratego, Shogi and Go.
main game example can be stratego board, but can be varied. 
the idea is that the no-mans-land, is arimaa style traps,
each player starts with an empty board,
each player gets 4 moves per turn.
in first turn they must put down the flag.
putting down a piece is worth two moves,
shifting a piece is worth one move,
pushing or pulling a piece is worth two moves,
removing an own piece (other than flag) takes two moves,
removing a piece can only be done from players half of board,
and then only if it is not arrested.
when a piece falls into a trap it has a 50% chance of joining
the enemy arsenal, can flip a coin to find out.
when a piece tries to push or pull a piece of the same rank, it
has a 50% chance of success, can flip a coin to find out.
1908 thinking of the chessboard version which has perfect
knowledge.  instead of "traps", can have the rooks as courts. 
taking the enemy king to your court wins the game. 
the courts have to be on the players half of the board, and can
not be moved afterwards.  this is equivalent to the bombs of the
stratego, and king being the flag. 
when pushing or pulling a piece arrests another, so it can't
move any further. 
when you have two pieces of equal rank, there is a 50% chance of
the arrest being a success, and a failed arrest still takes 2
turns, just as a successful pull would. only way to get
unarrested is if a friendly piece successfully arrests the
initial piece. 
after being taken to court a piece has a 50% chance of joining
the other side (one heads up), or going to prison (out of game).
in terms of placing new pieces on the board,
for maximum realism, it can be adjacent to current unarrested
pieces.
bishops can have a 1 in four chance of converting an adjacent 
piece (two heads up). attempting conversion can take 2 turn,
courts and kings can not be converted. 
technically can have the black side having imams, and islamic
names for the pieces *shrugs* but that may raise tensions.
or people can name the bishops based on the leaders of their own
faiths,  chiefs, priests, or w/e. in mwak there would be just
one term for it likely anyways.
rankins (for arrests) would be, court ∞, queen 4, bishop 3, 
knight 2, pawn 1, king 0. 
to make it really interesting can make it so that a piece has 
a chance of fighting back. so a pawn could have a 1:4 chance of
arresting a queen, and 1:3 chance of arresting a bishop,
or can double those odds to make it easier to coin flip for it.
so 1:8 queen (4 head up), 1:6 bishop (3 head up), 1:4 knight (2
head up), 1:2 pawn, (1 head up). knight's chances, 
2 head up for bishop, 3 head up for queen. bishops chance, 
2 head up for queen.
can call it spirit court. 
pawns can be worshipers, or officers. 
special powers:
a queen (secretary COO) can arrest two pieces.
a bishop (treasurer CFO) has a chance to convert others.
a knight (helicopter CTO) can skip over piece(s) during a move.
a pawn (officer) is the base class.
a king (president CEO) can't be converted.
in this case can all it Officer's Court.
2014 anyways can do more vocab work.
} Mar 26 2015
0600 so now can try adding javascript translation at the phrase 
level, and the sentence level ya Can do XML also. though might
be easiest once done the javascript ya
0614 okay working for phrases, now for sentence level
0726 hmm multi word quote not rendering properly
0939 it is fine at the type and phrase level, but stops working
at the sentence level
0940 I'll have to update test to check it at sentence level
0949 okay fixed, it was type copying issue.
1004 I should probably also do some disambiguating, and put my
foot down on at least supporting the basic PIE cases. anyways
that is afternoon stuff. for now lets see how good we can make
this javascript translation, need mwq conjugation
1031 okay now need to pass down conjugation level
1033 maybe should make a meta object, that can have type: and
conjugationLevel
or we can make it a part of format. nah, format is passed from
user wheras meta is for internal use., meh easiest would simply
be to use undefined at this time anyways.
1059 awesome is now fully operational :-D
eng : be say, "hello world". 
javs : say( "hello world" );
mwak : ksa fyas hello world fyas tsi .a yan .i ya
1212 anyways time to do some disambiguating
1214 what are the basic PIE cases?
(nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, ablative, locative, vocative, and possibly a directive or allative)
su, ob, of, to, by, from, in(at), hello, (towards?/till)
1302 disambiguated everything up to thai
2217 great so now every language is free of duplicates.
2325 managed to set up dative declensions for Russian, doesn't
quite work with type junctions, and phrase junctions seem to be
broken, but otherwise is a big step in the right direction. can
do subject and object declensions tommorrow. 
} 27 Mar 2015
0539 so the main things to get full conjugation support, is
phrase aspect, and to debug phrase junctions. can probably
remove type junctions, as we they serve the same function but
are more confusing and thus harder to code for.
0548 hmmm we have a rather tight javascript roadmap though.
I guess we can consider the support of phrase junction
debugging.
0550 hmmm maybe we should support type junctions, for the long
lists of things, yada, bada, wada, and lada kinda stuff.
0551 okay so to support it, we'll have to pass the case
information to the junction's types.
0600 fixed phrase junctions, but now the while clause
disappeared. seems like it's skipping the while word.
may be issue with sentence parsing.
0605 could also be issue with parsing.
0621 want to improve the French so can talk to my French
LibreWare friend, then Arabic for Ali the blind programmer. 
0623 first it is best to finish Russian.
0624 oh and to make a test for that parsing issue
0629 k made a test for it.
0657 integrated all of Russian, except for exceptions.
0719 okay also debugged it a bit
} Mar 28 2015
0156 thinking about how venus would be great for making aerogel,
and they could have wind power converters for energy. at first
was thinking wind turbines, but there may be other ways such as
piezo electrics or something, waving grass style wind power
converters, fewer places for dust to get in.
0204 oh I found something that may be better than hydrogen
lengths, atomic units.  seems like planck units would be best.
0223 only issue with that I see is that the theories of physics
it's based on may change..
0225 guess we can call them quantum units
0330 adding math words
tak 	add
yut	subtract
payt	multiply
kuft	divide
mult 	modulo
kisp	exponent
lumk	logarithm
niyt	nth-root
1241 I should make a verbBack or something, to put the verb at
the end for SOV languages like mwak.
1315
mast matter
syat solid
clut supercritical-fluid
liyk liquid 
kaws air-gas
plam plasma
milt melt
pyul boil
nyus ionize
salm sublimate
tlun triple-point
kuyt critical-point
tyis transition
2350 added a bunch of matter phases.  
so venus does have an ocean, it's simply made of supercritical
carbon-dioxide fluid.
can even have submarines, and possibly "surface" sailboats,
since the density of liquid carbon dioxide is 770kg/m^3,
assuming that the super-fluid is the same so only

} Mar 19 2015
0837 so I should put the aspect on the roadmap,
I'm just not sure how aspect can relate to javascript.
1117 so how do we do nominal sentences? if a sentence doesn't
have a verb, than can send it over the nominalConjugte.
1119 or more simply, can see if it hasCopula. 
1120 also can add in text header, and possibly footer,
that way can output javascript files.
1156 thinking should call the node javasc either nojs or jsno
1213 awesome so I now have it compiling to javascript,
and the file is executable. good stuff
1800 put aspect and plurals on the roadmap in the 0.7 chain
will probably need to do verb agreement, and move the functions
from accepting preconjugated output to simply the objects
themselves. such as how quote function does it now. it will
require a bigger overhaul, but will allow for much better
fidelity, and easier scripting, less duplicate or useless work.
1802 anyways since it is evening time to do more vocabulary
work. lets see if we can add farsi/persian also.
1841 okay so it's translating, already have 327 words defined.
can add some more
2358 need to do some rearrangement for length height width, and
green
} Mar 31 2015
0641 
lin length
tup depth
sik height
yac width
kis high
til low
pas fast
lat slow
0719 anyways lets try and do some programming
0721 first up lets add nominative sentences
0738 okay will have to convert the subject and object phrases to
accept language and phrase object
0756 gonna need some serious debugging
1104 nominal sentences work :-)
1305 seems aspect will be needed sooner rather than later
I'll make it the next point on the roadmap
1050 updated sentence to have a head instead of endWords
1439 anyways so can do some more word translations
1850 maybe should do more of that feasibility analysis stuff.
though that might make more sense after at least a preliminary
working version. 
it would be nice if could send the translated summary. though I
guess that would be besides the point. 
2108 having reviewed the linguistic universals for
postpositional languages it seems the majority have suffixing
for aspect/number/gender 
I'm thinking of parsing it out by word form, so CV and CCV words
would be considered part of the limb of the phrase.
what I can do is have a variable that indicates if the limb is
at head or tail, this may vary for English, since limb is always
initial, both in verbs and nouns. don't know about other
languages. but perhaps we can just have a limbFinal variable,
and otherwise consider that it is initial. can translate the
phrase body and parse out the grammar words, they will be added
to limb, and the remainder will be the word body.
then the limb can be used for conjugation purposes.
2114 meanwhile lets see if we can do a next step in business
plan. from-source Preparing Effective Business Plans
2116 one page 500 words  including
* description of product or service
* intended target market
* benefits of the product or service
* description of how product or service will be positioned
  relative to competitors
* brief description of the companie's management team
main headings:
Product
Target Market
Position
Management
2237 started writing concept test, bumped into the fact there is
interlignua machine translation, a fairly similar concept to
SPEL. and that many translation softwares already translate most
stuff, and then just ask about what it has trouble with.
so we really need the translate to computer programming
languages as a differentiating factor. 
} 01 Apr 2015
0555 i'll add programming keywords which have good overlap for
now.
0642 added a few, not sure how deep to go since don't know are
we supporting all paradigms :-O= or just the best, FPGA
VHDL compatible ones ++ (functional dataflow). 
0643 anyways lets see if we can add aspect
it would be under phrase
0704 okay coded it in phrase, now need to code the parsing
hmmm also wondering if perhaps it should actually be in type
rather than phrase.. since it's the few dogs, rathern that few
the dogs. 
yes definitely in type.
hmmm actually it is more difficult in type..
maybe in word? no that's too fine..
I have an idea, the limb can be the type head.
simply need better type head parsing, to include potentially
multiple words.
0739
tak add
yun subtract
pis multiply
cif divide
mul modulo
1423 okay so in any case probably best thing to work on for that
would be the parser of grammar words. anyways it's back to vocab
time for now, need to do the numbers 0 through 11.
as a reminder single character numbers are
m k y p w n s t l h f c r b g d z j
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f g h

1450 okay after I'm done adding those will make the 24 version 
1525 okay made it
dwuf 	twelve
trin	thirteen
srat	fourteen
pest	fifteen
tsen	sixteen
2230 added all the numbers
} 02 Apr 2015
0652 so thinking can copy some of wordPhonotactics to help with
phoneme recognition, since we need to identify if a word is CV
or CCV  to identify it as a grammar word
0716 okay wrote the tozenize wordGlyphClassGet, now to test
0720 so I was thinking of paying people less for overtime, to
discourage overtime. if people work more than 4-6 hours, then
their performance decreases, so it makes sense that they would
get less monetary compensation for their lower quality output.
0724 great getting glyph class works, now to get grammar words
0729 cool got isGrammarWord working.
0734 now I guess can use it in parser to make typeHeadGet
0800 okay now to test it
0808 great it works :-)
0811 next will have to integrate it with typt
1440 joseph is "add" so tak, though maybe best to transliterate.
1611 it's okay I like the meaningful names, keeps things lively.
though the transliteration is the more natural way to go.
place names hmm. 
1709 I sent in a story to science fiction daily.
1716 will need to fix up subject prominence, 
added 24glyph words to vocab listing. will be able to add the

2204 seriously considering simply moving all the text over to
IPA instead of ascii.. but dono. maybe a premature move still.
especially considering the keyboards and http limitations. 
though for typographically, or conjugated output, I think it
would be the ideal.
hmm, meh, guess it's best to work within confines of https for
now, and then can have the nice IPA output later. I have
difficulty typing IPA into this ssh forwarded gvim.
2238 hmmm, seems like even normal gvim doesn't have support for
it. 
2242 seems like it's a gvim bug, doesn't have ibus support, or
disables it somehow. or vim gnome has support.

English.
nam number
sya singular

0642 added PIE level number to vocab.
0645 added to the grammar

0703 I may have to set upper limit on length of multi word quote
to ease debugging.
0739 there are over 430 words now :-)
0740 still have at least 700 more to go though
anyways lets test plurality.
0747 typeHeadIndex might have forgotten to do the translation
1507 might have to do the translation in type. as typicall
grammar parse doesn't have access to language.
1533 okay fixed. now lets get conjugating
1559 will need a verbTypeConjugate and nounTypeConjugate for
english ideally.
1625 seems like translate isn't working in type properly.
1626 okay fixed seems like

2119 so in the next week I'll smooth out English, French and
Russian conjugation in that order. 
} 06 Apr 2015
0703 so I'm thinking of using the 32 glyph alphabet,
no point really of the 24 glyph one, since it takes 5 bits to
represent anyways. well actually 24 is near average which is
22+-3  the 32 range is moderately large.. oh actually that's for
consonants, so at 23 consonants it is in the average range with
32 glyphs total. so we are clear for take-off :-D.
just got to edit the wordPhonotactics to be more IPA compliant
by having the tones after the vowel.
0755 there is a bug that it is allowing ununique phonemes if
there is a tone..
} 07 Apr 2015
0708 okay so the plan is to make a reply to THOMAS in English
and French, via mwak translation. then to do so for Igor.
once French and Russian are working, can set it up a script
which allows me to (optionally) post translations of changelog
updates to twitter. or if I manage to get it working, then a
gnusocial like loadaverage.
0717 vocabUpdate hangs.
0727 seems to be quoteExtract, hangs on na, which gets repeated
forever.
1300 fixed that bug, it was a na which was supposed to be nya
1423 hmmm it seems to be having some difficulty with loading C32
1527 anyways I guess it is pretty huge.. can stick to the simple
stuff for now, the C16 and X16, until we have the basic stuff
implemented down pat.
hopefully will be able to recode it in mwak, which will have
opencl or at least parallel support so that it can happen
faster. it seems to be CPU bound. 
2203 after reviewing gnu social and related services on the
ostatus federated network. I've come to some conclusions of what
I want out of a federated network.
I want one ID, which I can use to login to all services,
and I don't mean something as ineffeable and hard to use as
OpenID. I mean something simple like a public encryption key.
I also want to be able to quickly and easily both invite and add
contacts. Most of the networks I've joined like gnusocial and
pump.io don't even seem to have an add contacts feature. wheras
in friendica it's difficult to find and is rather confusing.
I guess since talking about ideals here, of course email and IRC
integration would be nice. 
honestly like I don't understand OAuth at all, maybe it's good I
dono.
anyways I'm sure freenet and some others have unique user
identifiers which are similar.
to make them easier to remember, can use the sha1sum of the key,
and to make that easier can use base 55440 if 32 glyph vocab,
 or base 2520 if 16 glyph vocab.
okay if it is based 4095 they have to remember 14 words.
which is easier than remember 29 random ASCII glyphs of base64.
2230 anyways that was a bunch of useless discussion, I'm no
security expert. main thing I wanted was to be able to add
users, like it doesn't seem like such a hard thing, but perhaps
it is.
2239 awesome someone helped me figure it out :-D
2327 hmmm mwak should front top clauses in SOV.

} 08 Apr 2015
0014 okay finally, anyways sleepy time.
0657 having some issues with the aspect parsing or something, it
seems to parse it correctly, but later on it doesn't know what
it's doing.
0702 weird it definitely parses correctly.
0709 oh nm it works fine, I was just confused.
though it does mean that now more comes after the noun,
which is the confusing part.. since it's kind of an adjective.
0750 hmmm, comparatives are a bit confusing in this regard,
typically locatives are used for them.
more easy is easier in that sense it is a suffix.
okay well otherwise it's like an adjective *Shrugs*
lets try reworking them as root words then.
1000 but for now it's still programming time, conjugation stuff.
1014 okay English is at acceptable level, now working on
French.
1059 adding in past tense for english.
1132 anyways need to fix the glaring more/most stuff
1155 okay so have to fix nominals, it is a nominal if it lacks a
verb, or if the verb phrase has no body.
1236 okay next is verb conjugation of french for future and past
also present. can start with regular verbs and then add the
irregular ones.
2101 so have idea about a simple statement and it's translation.
thinking can make twitter worthy conjugation, by making topics
into hashtags. 
about SPEL su it in early phase of growth ya
eng: it is in early phase of growth #SPEL .
javs: var SPEL = {"about":"SPEL"}; var it = SPEL;
it.in = "early phase of growth";
2144 anyways time to fix up those correlatives and superlatives.
2333 posted hello world in the twitter languages on my twitter, 
and in the gnusocial languages in my gnu social.
} 09 Apr 2015
0745 weird conjugation level isn't passing properly to sentence
from clause.
0749 okay fixed. now sentence level conjugation.
0802 okay it works :-D.
0812 hmm I think I have to make it so the phraseOrder is
preserved and then the various topic fronting and performance
grammar can go around that core.
1045 okay now javascript translation is working fairly well.
1141 attempting to get subPhrase to work.
1154 should make sentence.of = "nominal" if it is a nominal
sentence, that way onl have to check at creation time.
1225 javascript is noun initial, can compose words with .
1243 probably going to have to change the glottal-stop from a
period to an underscore so that it is easier to pack into
variable_names. also wont need to escape it for regular
expressions.

even not live streaming. ttyrec doesn't compalin though.
} 19 Apr 2015
0553 so managed to get typreccast which does livestreaming of
content. thus eventually I'll be able to livestream when I'm
coding. 
0606 fixing up javascript conjugation.
0608 hmmm objectMake may have to work with sentences in order
to fix it up, or find out whether it is nominal. though I guess
it could find out based on the phrase, 
0618 oh right have to finish replacing the dots with underscores
0656 translationUpdate working, updating test.js
0730 okay fixed up for most of tests, just have two more
junction tests to pass.
0734 it might be a problem with the quote recognition.
0754 bah seems like the type or junction is not even using the
proper parsing function, will have to fix it.
0830 finally is fixed.
0832 can include tests for duplicates in the test.sh
would motivate to keep it up to date.

1338 an issue I've come across is that some words are nouns and
others are verbs, instead of having all of each kind, perhaps it
would be good to somehow indicate whether it is a noun or verb,
or stick to just one case.. i.e. accusative, and then conjugate
all others out of it. though what would be the accusative of
"go"?  hard to say, so I guess we're left with having to specify
if it is a noun or verb for conjugation purposes. or else have
different definitions for each, which would be burdensome.
1341 for instance I'm not sure should actually split student and
study, perhaps will get rid of student, since it can be tsumhu
the one who studies. 
1356 so maybe it will be easier to simply add in for instan
tsumhu, I simply have to update the vocabUpdate script, to add
the new entry if it doesn't already exist.
on the otherhand, tsumhu is more of a definition.
1359 for instance oxford-3000 has both student and study, grow
and growth, but not grower.
1405 hmmm but there is only room for ~2000 words in core.
so we should really be looging at special english with it's
~1600 word vocab. and it doesn't have growth. 
} 12 Apr 2015
0538 added nominal flag to sentence if it detects that it is a
nominal.
0641 next main thing is verb conjugation, or verb agreement, can
pass it a whole sentence, but only expect a verb phrase in
return.
0650 okay added preliminary catch for it, but now sleepy time.
1103 have an extra semicolon in my javascript output, and part
of my verbs seems to be disappearing.
1747 okay french works for future tense, adding present tense.
} 13 Apr 2015
0439 woke up today with an interest in supporting runic
alphabet. similarly it would be nice to translate mwak to IPA.
0451 anyways so I'll probably just do IPA for now, for instance
if the conjugation is greater than 5
0616 it's so frustrating, for the last horu it seems I've been
trying to get the function to include in the mwak conjugation
grammar but it simply refuses to do so.
0636 excellent it is working now :-D
1114 I'm thinking that the IPA can be a format triggered thing.
script could be the variable.
1155 considering chaging _u _i _a to something else, 
with some kind of easy to pronounce consonants.
glottal stops really break up the language too much.
maybe I'll use h's instead of glottal stops,
and use glottal stops for compounds?
h is more common than glottal stops.
so it would be hi ha hu
1201 okay well I recently changes it to underscores, 
so can certainly change it to h's, it does make the language
sound a lot better. k I'll do it.
1221 awesome, it's really nice now.
1227 I'd like it to be verb backing though.
1250 some kind of weird error cropped up when I changed around
how subject fronting happens to do with TopClauses, not sure
why.
1300 cool fixed, next will add verb backing.
2114 so I want to make the base eight cases 2 letter words,
which are easy to distinguish from each other. 
hu su subject nominative
ha pa object accusative
hi yi verb

2247 okay it's all updated now :-D
2251 I want to add stress marks to mwak also.
} 15 Apr 2015
0151 added stress to mwak for conjugation level  12 and over
0333 finished adding past tense to French.
0342 next will be spanish conjugation, then Russian.
for now, sleep.
1421 okay added spanish conjugation. now smoothing out the
spanish vocabulary.
1459 okay now I just need to make javascript accept multiple
dictionaries, or rather alternative dictionaries to the english
one.
2127 adding implicit nominal verbAgreement;
1921 thinking I can use X24 for proper nouns and such.
2349 found a place in phrase where it seems the junctions aren't
working properly. they work in subPhrase however.

0605 can have a serverside script, that generates a new wallet
for each bug/issue
0609 we could have something like TM (translation memory), but
instead of between languages, it would be between a natural
source and it's analytic/SPEL-accessible. variant.
0613 in terms of ABI, I was thinking can have an index-like jump
table, which points to for instance a list of words that have
the same initial letter. The words would be Mwak words, so
fairly short. The system could then find what function it needs
by finding the appropriate word.
0618 I think the hardest part will be effectively coordinating
mass collaboration. Obviously that means the remove bottlenecks,
but also to detect bottleanecks. 
1024 adding possessive pronouns.
} 20 Apr 2015
0844 so I'm thinking should get back to completing Igor's
project. the more revenue we have the better, can put the money
into a pot for the currency shares, to pay developers and such.
0845 otherwise next is probably conditionals 
0748 I also have that whole genitives attach to type thing...
I dono, I guess they do..  *shrugs* ummm so ya, gotta do that
soonish, cause I already have a bunch of subphrase stuff going
on. it's gonna need some major rewrites.. 
1228 Uralic languages are SOV, so I'll change hungarian and
finnish to the SOV branch. also probably german... though they
use prepositions, so otherwise SVO,  same for dutch,  since they
use SOV in their subclasues, I guess any subclause SOV, I'll
move over to SOV, best keep with the motherlang afterall ya
1449 added articilization to French, now is more natural.
1451 I need subclause backing for clause final and subclause
fronting for clause initial
1511 will do that later, for now added gender recognition to
Russian.  and improved text formating of output.
1513 also need to make french recognize "an", or one, and put
that in, instead of a le when appropriate. 
1514 also I'd like to add adjective declensions to Russian as
soon as possible.
} 21 Apr 2015
0122 can have optional adjective and adverb ending words, mostly
for high noise scenarios, but also to free up word order.
similarly to Russian. though ya, it is very low priority at the
moment.  more pertinent is getting Russian adjectives
conjugation for output.
0242 I also need something that can switch word classes for me,
so I don't need to define an adjective and noun etc for each.
like describe and descrpition, or possible, possibly,
and possibility,
0248 it would require a somewhat more complex dictionary.
0257 guess I'll sleep on it.
0323 can use those adjective, noun, verb markers I was talking
about earlier. then translate toMwak can simply have all of them
as inputs, wheras translate from mwak will be subdivided into
the word classes.
0812 I just found out that adjective following noun is more
common than preceding, so we'll have to move mwak around to do
that. can probably rename the corresponding variables also.
can call it adjectiveFinal and adverbFinal.
0815 okay should be a simple enough fix, just gotta double check
the adverb bit.
0948 hmmm it seems that clauseFinal, and adjective final is the
most common. as well as mood initial. yet postpositions and
genitive initial. it seems rather confusing to me. 
if mwak is made clause final, then it will be right branching,
and thus will lean towards SVO. 
0950 while languages may have started out as SOV, the general
pattern seems to be to move into SVO, and possibly into VSO, but
some VSO languages move back into SVO, wheras no SVO languages
naturally move into SOV, only through influence of many SOV
neighbours.  thus it seems that SVO, maybe the most "natural" or
universal word-order, since it has a high rate of "sticking"
factor. 
0957 just because SOV was the original word order, doesn't mean
it's the best one. 
1007 well and obviously programming languages are all SVO or
VSO.  I'm not aware of any SOV programming languages other than
current incarnation of mwak. 
1011 anyways we can keep it all as is, since it is the closest
to the proto-human language. can always later on make some kind
of SVO relative of it.  but for now, this is best.
1022 sumerian is SOV, inflected, with adjectiveFinal and
clauseFinal. hmmm
1104 they were however a mix of cultures, semitic, samara and
arabians.  
1124 it seems chinese may be one of the oldest scripts. 
1132 it makes sense to stick with chinese/hindu style since they
are the most likely to support machine intelligence due to their
beliefs in reincarnation or rebirth, and animist leanings. 
1134 it seems the "pure" SOV languages in the china, north asia
and India area, all have adjective-noun, genitive-initial,
clause-initial.  Wheras the noun-adjectives SOV languages are
mostly in the america's which are influenced by a variety of VO
languages. also the relative clause and noun sample on wals
doesn't seem to include most of north asia and uralic languages.
1159 so mwak seems best suited for haplogroup M people of SOV.
1200 the strong pioneers though are haplogroup N, of the SVO. 
1200 thus I'm thinking of making a second version of mwak,
call it something else.. perhaps share vocabulary, but be SVO
style. leaning towards haplogroup N.
Naomi is the hypothetical mother of Haplo N, so maybe can call
it nawm. or nwam.  it is also for l1 and and l2 which are SVO,
so perhaps nlam which isn't actually legal in mwak .. hmm
lamn name in hittite, also other langs are in the extended
section, so this one could be also..  and N 
1242 hmmm but N also seeded the Urals, and yet they are SOV.
in fact N seeded most of northern Asia, which is mostly SOV.
only Europe (IJK) and Oceania (F) of the N has changed to SVO.
also some of the ones that went over to the Americas of course..
but the ones in the N homeland, north-central-asia, are all SOV. 
so it was certainly SOV when M and N diverged. 170-70kya
2230 Sandawee and KhoiKhoi also are SOV and the are the oldest
L0 branch, so more SOV points. also Sandawee has stems which are
common and simply modified for adjective, verb or noun, so we'll
do likewise.  so need a word for adjective
2233
twif adjective	kfat	kfa
niym noun  	tsun	tsu
wiyp verb 	pyif	pyi
} 22 Apr 2015
1235 gotta fix up the numerals to be compliant with the single
glyph number system. 
m k y p w n s t l h f c
kiyn kiym one
tful twuk two
tyin tsiy three
1323 okay so I have the affixes for now
kfa pyi tsu, covers adjective verb, noun, just like in wordnet.
guess we'll try it with describe description for now. 
describe can be the default or verb, description is noun, and
descriptive is adjective. 
descriptive kfa ki description tsu ki describe pyi ha
1328 okay before we implement this lets get everything updated
and saved. 
1337 so how do we implement this exactly? 
I guess the first stage will be the dictionary has to support
it, so we can try making the modifications in for instance
eng.txt or even smaller sample file. 
then will need to update the translator, so that it would
translate each word, and output it appropriately.
our dictionary will have a toMwak, which will contain all the
words as source words, so it will be fairly easy to go to mwak.
the fromMwak, will have sub-tables for noun, adjective, and
verb. and perhaps grammar words, or it could have a root or misc
section that has grammar words and default words, if for
instance the noun/adjective doesn't contian anything. 
guess we can call it main. 
1348 updated roadmap to reflect what is happening.
2112 
#MitochondrialEve spoke an SOV language during the depth of the 2nd last glacial period 130,000 years ago. #EarthDay #ProtoHumanLanguage

#MitochondrialEve (Meve) possible #Biography: She lived during the depth of second last glaciation, in the African Great Lakes area. There was a major famine and many didn't have enough food to reach fertility. Meve was a matriarch, much as in a pack of wolves, was the first to eat, and was not shy to have her fill, thus reached fertility. If a human female is on the cusp of having enough food for fertility they are more likely to have daughters. To increase likelihood of daughters further, her primary mate was probably an elder, or one of the oldest members of the group, the older a man is, the lower the likelihood of having a male offspring, due to the fragility of the Y-chromosome.
After having successfully had 6 or more children, her reputation likely soared, and her daughters then became the group leaders of neighboring groups, where they followed the same successful strategies. To this day, Meve's female descendants prefer older men, and Demand food when pregnant or lactating.

#CO2 for the golden age of bio mass on earth, 300million to 66 million years ago, levels have been 1-2% currently they are 0.4%. #Earthday
2133 Y-Chromosonal (Yadam) likely had a completely different
strategy from Meve. He most likely lived in the depths of the 
3rd last glaciation, around 250 thousand years ago. 
his strategy likely involved forming raiding parties for
acquiring food from other hominids. During the raid all or most
of the reproductive age males would be eliminated, and the 
females would be impregnated. Likely there was some
stock-selection, to make sure that the offspring would breed
true. so for groups which were too hairy, or whose foreheads
weren't high enough even the women and babies were killed, 
being judged as animals.  burning of their shelters is quite
possible also, which would both disinfect the area, and lower
the chances of retaliation, while increasing the likelyhood of
warming. rape, pillage and burn (RPB) basically. 
This kind of selection can explain why so little interbreeding
occured with other hominid species. shortly after the bottleneck
the weather started to warm up pretty fast, so the raiding
parties expanded. 
It is quite possible, even likely, that these were food
gathering raids, and that they had their own tribe of women
somewhere, which they would return to after a raid to get food.
The RPB strategy minimized potential for retaliation, and later
on the young of the raided could be recruited, assuming they
looked sufficiently like Yadam. 
When Yadam got older, into his fortiesTanganyikatrong and mean to women or children due to their dull wits.
 which motivates Yadam to rile fellow small-brow, high foreheads
 to commit mass genocide.
0819 for the cover photo can have a thinnish health-weight

1131 Lyra could have been the pole star while Mave was alive
1308 as a child perhaps Paydam witnessed the brutish raids of
the homo heid, which had large brows and low foreheads, they
were likely stronger and bulkeir, so Paydam's families usual 
strategy was that of the Chetah, to outrun them. When the food
and water got scarce, it promoted everyone to move into the
river valleys, such as the Omo river valley.  There they were
forced into confrontation with the Heid, which they had to
exterminate in order to get their food and water. since they had
larger brains, and higher ground and speed, 
they managed to do it. 
perhaps by distracting them and then burning their villages,
afterwhich they could pick them off. 
Paydam didn't have to do it much, he just had to start the
pattern, which his sons would follow.
perhasp they could have been called, high brow, where high was
also big, like tall.  thus it was the high brows (homo 
heidelbergensis) vs the low brows (homo sapiens)
2257 I think it'll just be easier to use description for now,
nouns are easier to use, and make into verbs.
2300 otherwise considering using old english conjugation for
words, though I'm guessing that wont be necessary, can simply
just use a single word form. 
2301 instead next I'll do sub-clause forwarding, or backing as
the case may be. subclause realignment I guess.
2314 old-english (simplified) 
- adjectives are stem form

-an plural noun

-sye future tense (from PIE)
+-n subjunctive addition

0737 subjective is used for random grammatical stuff in
grammatical languages, so guess we wont use it, just like we
have to mostly avoid le articles, due to their overuse in
french.
0749 thus can stick to the simple mood system we have thus far.
0752 anyways meanwhile can add adjectives for the rest of the
russian cases. 
so accusative, dative, nominative, instrumental
0757 also need to identify if it is plural.
0830 adding paucal and multal
1341 added english verb conjugation, based on modern english.
though used accusative case from old english.
1341 need to add verbAgreement conjugation to Russian.
1354 okay so we need to get the stem, 
1443 basically or almost have first class of russian words
1529 so I just figured out that "some" is plural in English.
hmmm it's not quite the same.
1531 seems like it may be best to put words in a "to verb"
fashion, as it is more likely to generate an infinitive which is
easier to conjugate in other languages.

1000 discovered "evidence based" programming language, called
Quorum, it is based on studies of what makes programming easier.
1012 currently the array-selection version of of, is really
part-of, wheras if we were to do templating it would be
composed-of. for instance
early phase part-of growth
growth[phase.early];
array composed-of integer
Array<Integer>;
though in javascript array of integer would be nonesense,
since all arrays are composed of references. 
1016 Quorum uses repeat instead of loop, we can also.
1025 though there are typed arrays in javascript,
ary composed-of Integer could become Int32Array.
1225 so based on conversations with my wife, one of the best
ways of explaining programming is via method of the abacus. 
so I've come up with a binary abacus, that can be used by anyone
with all their fingers, to represent a byte, thumb binary. 
it can be made into a keyer glove, but is also useful for some
simple calculations.

0000 thinking of making so as cu, if I use it for output
setting.
0644 another option is to have a word for subject that is being
defined, as opposed to agent doing the action. 
otherwise since none of them are being used twice, and all of
them continue to exist, it is actually optional to differentiate
the signal names. though for static-single-assignment it would
be easier.
0652 I guess tripartite would make it easiest. 
0710 actually can make destination in dative, 
and then the one that gets modified is object,
and by what it is modified is instrumental.
1455 weird it is double translating on input it seems.
1513 so still thinking about inflecting it, can't really call it
old english, since old english was just so different,
but perhaps we can borrow some stuff for modern english..
or at least spel computer english.
it seems we might just be able to keep it in infinite -an,
much like the romance languages. 
1519 om is used in proto-indo-european, 
so we could actually be somewhat esperanto-like,
and use -a for adjectives, -and -o for nouns,
-om or -on for accusative case. 
anyways lets try it with -an's  via ang for now.
} 28 Apr 2015
0041 added noun and adjective conjugation for English, it
already works for Russian. also added mood conjugation for
English, still have to do for russian. and also have to add
participle conjugation for all languges.
0946 so after English can do French,
participles end with -ant, and adverbs with -ent
0950 anyways what's left for English is participles.
0959 hmmm there is overlap between old english imperative and
old english plural, so looking for a difference earlier on.
1005 might be able to use an o, or something like that -oth
perhaps instead of -ath.  anyways so participles.
1046 okay so finished participles, great so english is pretty
good now.
1242 so I should probably make that conjugation dictionary also,
that converts opinon to opinion and describon to description,
for all the various exceptions which a langauge may have.
can have it for conjugation levels higher than 7 or something.
0416 right so a few more plural cases for Russian
0443 okay need future tense also.
0551 okay added, seems to all work now.
2023 hmmm in my Chinese the object isn't following the verb,
weird.
2042 maybe it's some clauseInitial stuff or something.
2053 seems it's not matching the caseWords properly.
2059 I untranslated the casewords to make it work, but not sure
why they were translated in the first place, I think they were
being used for something, not sure what though.
2103 now it thinks everything is a nominal.
2212 okay I fixed it up.
} 04 May 2015
0707 m k y p w n
} 04 May 2015
1112 can't understand participles, thought they were adverbs,
but apparently they are more vague, not a true part of speech,
so will change Englisho to reflect this. 
Also thinking that it seems the subject or nominative case is
most likely to retain the case ending, so can figure out an
appropriate case ending that distinguishes subject from
"oblique". either all the others will be an's as in the current
nominative or something else. 
0744 looked at poetry for function layout.
1120 may be able to set up performance testing to find what
parts of algorithm need to be optimized so can use larger
dictionaries.
1409 anyways so conditionals. 
2211 cool getting close
just got some extra close brackets somewhere.
} 06 May 2015
0703 so have to make final bracket and comparative tests.
0718 made final bracket, fixing up spanish output,
then will fix up chinese output.
0742 seems like if then statements are like in english,
and thus the reverse of their subordinate clauses.
1414 hmmm so an issue is comparatives, they are different in
different languages, and equals/identity is usually done through
nominals, yet comparatives are done in a variety of ways, such
as locatives, particles, conjoined and exceed comparatives.
} 07 May 2015
0650 so thinking of using ablative Locative for comparison, but
will give the mailing list a few days to respond. 
0652 have to fix chinese output anyways, also have to add more
vocabulary.  hmmm I'm guessing we can probably shift them over
to  TopClauseInitial, currently it is wrapped up with
clauseInitial, so will need to seperate those two.
} 08 May 2015
0604 can tune up mwak for better IPA output.
} 11 May 2015
0628 so comparatives
1343 there are at least two ways of implementing them. 
one is that can have special conjugation classes for them,
the other is can have API for them, which is preferable. 
so for instance:
su this be same from that ya
this.same({"from":(that)});

function same(args){
base = args.from;
if (base === this)
return true;
else return false; }

1849 while that may work for most cases, seems it would be best
to stuff it in the conjugator for performance reasons,
considering how common comparisons are in programming, forcing
them all to jump to another function would be a serious
performance loss.
} 12 May 2015
0446 implemented comparatives as compounds words, same big, same
small.  don't yet have support for junctions in a verb phrase.
0452 gotta fix up french translation.
0456 okay fixed, now nap time.
} 13 May 2015
0613 so now I guess it is comparative junctions.
the easiest are the phrase level junctions,
su this be same from that1 or that2 ya
su this and this2 be same from that ya
su this be small or big from that ya
wheras higher level junctions would be tougher,
can do some with yaor and while, but don't know how to put ones
in brackets.
for assembly level we already have enough complexity.
} 14 May 2015
0358 had a dream for a "Beer song" four liner. 
at first dreamed about an assembly version with a goto:
su number of bottle ob num 99 ya
su beer song be label ya
be say ob number of bottle and 
quote word bottles of beer on the wall word unquote ya
if number of bottle be big from 0 then be go to beer song ya
0407 then dreamed about the go to uproar and changed it to a
simple loop
su number of bottle ob num 99 ya
su beer song be start of repeat ya
be say ob number of bottle and 
quote word bottles of beer on the wall word unquote ya
if number of bottle be small from 0 then be stop ob repeat ya
su beer song be end of repeat ya
0436 okay so I'd like to try coding something in asm.js, ideally
I'd improve performance of SPEL, but to do that, would need to
know where performance can be improved, so would need some kind
of functioning performance analysis tool.
0450 hmmm maybe will have to just do some sample program or
something. one of the most obvious issues for the web-app
anyways is that it has to load a 4MB file, which is pretty
ridiculous, so will have to trim that down significantly. likely
by making the loading of the dictionaries through XHR request.
0546 anyways haven't actually made any asm js code thus far,
haven't been able to get any profilers working either. 
can just output something like a standard loop.

var bottle[number] = 99;//su number of bottle ob num 99 ya
while(true){//su beer song be start of repeat ya
console.log(bottle[number]+//be say ob number of bottle and 
//quote word bottles of beer on the wall word unquote ya
" bottles of beer on the wall ");
//if su number of bottle be small from 1 then be stop ob repeat ya
if (bottle[number] <1) break;
// else be decrement ob number of bottle ya
bottle[number]--
}//su beer song be end of repeat ya
0553 personally I think the goto makes more sense to novices,
though would have to ask on the mailing list I guess.
however goto has big trouble in terms of support,
so many people got so scared of it,
that many lost support for it.
0603 anyways got to catch hopefully at least 15min nap before
the baby wakes up.
0959 best to try to implement the minimum for now and then work
our way up, so probably loops before functions. usually
implemented with repeat hmm. 

su number of bottle ob num 99 ya

su chorus be start ya
be say ob number of bottle and
quote word bottles of beer on the wall, word unquote and
number of bottle and 
quote word bottles of beer. word unquote ya
be decrement ob number of bottle ya
be say ob
quote word take one down and pass it around, word unquote 
and number of bottle and 
quote word bottles of beer on the wall. word unquote ya
su chorus be end ya

be repeat ob chorus if number of bottle be big from 0 ya

1344 this would be equivalent to javascript of

var bottle = new Object();
var number = "number";
bottle["number"]=99;

function chorus(){
console.log(bottle[number]
+ " bottles of beer on the wall.");
console.log(bottle[number]
+" bottles of beer");
bottle["number"]--;
console.log("Take one down and pass it around, "
+bottle["number"]+" bottles of beer on the wall.");
}


while (bottle["number"]>0){
chorus();
}

1408 testing
1447 okay that layout seems good, the repeat turns into a while
statement. how about a for statement, how do we do that?
like 10 times, guess need to do some more research. on that.
meanwhile can ask mailing list about Early Modern English
conjugation. 
2134 anyways so how do we do for loops using repeat?
2159 was reading about benchmarks game, seems like we'll have to
make our own tests for that. 
2201 another option is to contribute to rosetta code, which has
many different tasks which are done in various languages. 
2212 they have over 700 tasks, but looping structures is one of
the basic ones. 
so there are for loops, and for-each loops,
there is also the parallel programming stuff map, reduce,
which are in some ways quite similar. 
for-loop:
be repeat for iterator from 99 til 0 ya
for-each:
be repeat for bottle list ya
map:
be repeat ob chorus for bottle list to out list ya
2247 oh right, so there is also else, not sure we have a word
for it in mwak, and else-if or elif
cya is else for now anyways.
sli is else-if.
2305 so reduce is best thought of as fold
be fold ob list by function to result ya
} 15 May 2015
0657 okay so functions are basically the same as the chorus,
except that they can have parameters, so for instance if chorus
took bottle as parameter.
su chorus be start ob bottle ya
su chorus be end ya
that would translate to:
function chorus(bottle){
}
A more sophisticated example would be for instance addition. 
I'm thinking maybe it is best to make with the instrumental, as
by can also be near. though I guess by translates to po in
russian, which is a purely instrumental thing, and there is the
word near or nearby in case we need to express something is 
near something else.  though generally tools are expressed with
with, rather than by.
anyways so addition
be add ob augend by addend to sum ya
be subtract ob minuend by subtrahend to difference ya
be multiply ob multiplicand by multiplier to product ya
be divide ob dividend by divisor to quotient ya
be modulo ob dividend by divisor to remainder ya
be nth-root ob radicand by degree to root ya
be exponent ob base by exponent to power ya
be logarithm ob antilogarithm by base to exponent ya
0744 now I'm thinking about the to part, since it could return a
value, or if there is no to then it can modify the object, this
would be consistent with how it works in assembly languages.
}16 May 2015
0459 that-which contents can be evaluated and is replaced by
it's result.
so 
be multiply ob num 4 by that-which be add ob 2 by 3 ya
becomes:
be multiply ob num 4 by num 5 ya
or more simply in the virtual machine assembly
where edx is to, and ebx is bo, and ecx is by
mov ecx,3
mov ebx,2
add ebx,ecx ; add it to bo
mov ecx,ebx ; move it to by
mov ebx,4;
add ebx,ecx;
} 16 May 2015
1644 I like the Sam command language, or at least the structured
regular expressions, especially because they are so composable.
will use it as a base for the SPEL text editor, which takes SPEL
commands as input for modifying files. that way can edit files
through speach. 
would need to have a way of expressing all the same things
regular expressions express, but through words instead of arcane
symbols. 
} 17 May 2015
0700 got to edit the Spanish conjugation a bit perhaps.
0716 thinking of making head stress mandatory, can lead to some
antibacchius poetry, but I guess it's okay.
0730 okay fixed it up, thus the mwak rhythms which are possible
are, trochee, antibachius, double trochee, ditrochee, dactyl,
and rarely primus paeon, that is for words themselves.
} 18 May 2015
1251 okay so next should be functions, blank functions like that
beer song file.  I can put the beer song into the spel test, so
can see how it parses for now.
2106 thinking about how to include toffoli, cnot and fredkin in
as natural a way as possible. 
not:
be flip ob abacus ya
cnot:
be flip ob abacus if condition ya
toffoli:
be flip ob abacus if condition and if other condition ya
fredkin:
be switch ob abacus by other abacus if condition ya
2116 fredkin OR-gate:
su other be num 1 ya
be switch to r ob y by other if x ya
fredkin AND gate:
su result be num 0 ya
be switch to r ob result by y if x ya
toffoli AND gate:
su result be num 0 ya
be flip to r ob result if x and if y ya
NAND gate:
su result be num 0 ya
be flip to r ob that-which be flip ob result if x and if y ya
2138 hmmm I might need a case-level if for these. 
 I could use when I guess.  either that or if's would have to be
subordinatable. which would be somewhat harder.   
XOR gate:
su result be 0 ya
su other be 1 ya
be switch ob result by other when x ya
be switch ob result by other when y ya
2211 okay so set up the beer song in spel-test, will have to
debug it and such. also have to add some more vocab words.
} 19 May 2015
0417 okay so gotta add a few more vocab words at least.
0434 hmmm seems flip and switch are rare words.  can use trade
instead of switch. can use turn instead of flip.
turn is also good analogy for qubits,
somewhat like Pauli-X gate, which rotates by pi around the x
axis.
0453 so toffoli:
be turn ob x when a and when b ya
fredkin:
be trade ob x by a when b ya
0500 okay anyways time to start implementing the song.
reverse is turn around. 
0527 guess I need a conjugation.text kind of thing.
0552 have an idea of what participles are for.  its the
difference between sentences.pop and sentences.pop(), the second
being the participle form.  so if a  verb is used in a noun
phrase, it can be in participle form.
0601 okay cool got basic subText to function conversion.
next can convert the non comparative and's into plus signs.
0702 updated it.  next will need to get those sub phrases as sub
types, and number types.
1001 thinking about vowels and such. 
based on formants it's better to use /ɛ/ instead of /e/ and /ɔ/
instead of /o/.
also thinking about English vowels:
i /ɨ/
ie /I/
ai /e/
e /ɛ/
ae /æ/
a /a/
au /ɑ/
ou /o/
o /ɔ/
1014 oh w/e no one really cares about what I think about English
much anyways. so lets do some vocab work. or perhaps figure out
the subPhrases or numbers. 
1040 it is hanging up on quotes extract for numerals.
1055 debugged :-)
1058 next has to recognize numeral type, and conjugation will
return the contents of it. afterwards will work on fixing the
subPhrase to a subType. also possibly cleaning up the Type
identification loop, exporting as much as possible to external
modules or functions. 
1307 anyways vocabulary time :-). nice and easy stuff.
1903 adjusting numbers twuf for two
m k y p w n s t l f c
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A
0 nuls 1 kiyn  2 twuf 3 tyin 
4 pyit 5 fwap 6 silk 7 syim 
8 kcat 9 nift A tiyk
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A
n k w y p f l m c s t
1925 okay, so that will be the new glyph number sequence
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B 
n k w y p f l m c s t h
alphabet can be:
kyimf pha.ant swulc
2300 wrote a fictional autobiography introduction,
will translate it to SPEL and then post it in various languages.
} 20 May 2015
0703 so continue to debug I'm guessing.
0712 okay so numeral is now working. 
0717 next can add in the while loop, or fix the sub Types.
0718 I'm not 100% certain of the best syntax for while loops
yet, so I should work on sub types.. should do a git release
before I work on it though, since it can be messy.
