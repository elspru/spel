.34A05190B.mu.elspru.nwo lwetkxam in troclyac means evolutionary computer-programming
.34A071922.mu.pyic.nwo largest stable nuclide is 208 (Pb), so can set as max deme popultion for #geneticprogramming, 56 (Fe) should be top of bell curve.
.34A0728A7.mu.pyic.nwo paleolithic humans, and WoW guilds, are often most stable in 50-60 range, iron peak is most stable at isotope 56. #asabovesobelow
.34A0908A4.mu.pyic.nwo to increase diversity can have slightly different function sets when initializing deme (island) populations #geneticprogramming
.34A0915B6.mu.pyic.nwo crowd function set length can be between golden-ratio and 1/#goldenratio, select random from provided functions #geneticprogramming
.34A0AB373.mu.elspru.nwo #endogamy or #speciation as in #NEAT may be beneficial to arriving at optimal solutions sooners in #geneticprogramming
.34A0B1413.mu.elspru.nwo #fermiparadox can be neatly explained by #zoohypothesis, because allopatric #speciation improves galactic #geneticprogramming
.34A0B1558.mu.elspru.nwo maybe a #geneticprogramming goal of water-based life in the galaxy, is to make solid based life, to populate less habitable planets
.34A0B53B5.mu.elspru.nwo NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies #NEAT evolving #neuronets with #geneticprogramming
.34A0B5728.mu.elspru.nwo Oxygen is third most common element in the galaxy, its most stable isotope has 16 elements, can have 16 functions #geneticprogramming
