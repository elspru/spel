.347AAB875.mu.elspru.nwo finished cases and aspects
.347AAB878.mu.elspru.nwo working on moods
.347AB048B.mu.elspru.nwo okay finished moods
.347AB0550.mu.elspru.nwo still have to do pro-forms and suffixes, as well as a few minor ones.
.347B1450A.mu.elspru.nwo evidential-case should be added to caseTable
.347B14521.mu.elspru.nwo also best to make that initial translation working for ryip
.347B1454B.mu.elspru.nwo then can also have a seperate security bot, which will be responsible for oping, voicing, kicking and banning.
.347B14568.mu.elspru.nwo security-guard is xwax
.347B14591.mu.elspru.nwo military is slin
.347B14598.mu.elspru.nwo safe is sif
.347B145A8.mu.elspru.nwo security is synonym of safe and care
.347B1466A.mu.elspru.nwo I guess security-guard is the most pertinent.
.347B1913B.mu.elspru.nwo  sortWordBlacklist can be processed in transWordUnique
.347B19146.mu.elspru.nwo since all translations can be useful.
.347B19175.mu.elspru.nwo also have to make business cards and meditation course material for tommorrow in case someone shows up
.347B48749.mu.elspru.nwo so got idea that sris or ryip could cross post to gnusocial via bitlbee
.347B48754.mu.elspru.nwo also to twitter.
.347B48766.mu.elspru.nwo it would be possible to crosspost to the various gnusocial instances based on their primary language
.347B48792.mu.elspru.nwo the key thing would be to pick up responses, which I guess would be the job of ryip
.347B50436.mu.elspru.nwo anyways it seems like a distraction to be working on that stuff, it's been almost two hours and I've made little headway
.347B50545.mu.elspru.nwo okay I'll try to get it to simply connect to bitlbee and repost stuff there or something.
.347B5320B.mu.elspru.nwo okay so if this worked then it should cross post to gnusocial and twitter from IRC
.347B53403.mu.elspru.nwo testing crosspost
.347B5359A.mu.elspru.nwo testing crosspost again
.347B53785.mu.elspru.nwo crosspost test 3
.347B53860.mu.elspru.nwo w00t w00t crossposting worked :-) now #spel changelog is live
.347B54371.mu.elspru.nwo so next have to finish specifying grammar word lengths, and make alternatives such as "me" for first-person.
.347B5462B.mu.elspru.nwo ideally alternatives will also have a language parameter for those grammar words which don't have an English counterpart such as "ga" in Japanese for nominative case marking, and "wa" for topic case marking
.347B54732.mu.elspru.nwo that would mean the translation part would have to pick up the languages of alternatives and make sure there are translations available for them
.347B71A29.mu.elspru.nwo seems like the only truly portable form of parallelism is #OpenCl, and thus #WebCl for Javascript. OpenCl works in C and C++ also.
.347BA8B69.mu.elspru.nwo 180 degrees of appreciation #vipassana #observation_meditation
.347BB2516.mu.elspru.nwo  /names
.347BB2559.mu.elspru.nwo seems the bots sometimes quit,  though it's more rare, I'm not sure why they do it.
.348036979.mu.elspru.nwo okay, so barring any major revelations the language is pretty-much complete. I've decided not to bother with alternative-forms, will probably just use glossing-abbreviations for the SPEL variants of languages. attempting to use something like "with" would them prompt the user asking if they meant "instrumental-case" (ins) or "comitative-case" (com)
.34803710A.mu.elspru.nwo troclyash /troʃlyaʃ/ is the new name of the language, it means "international-language".　
.34803714B.mu.elspru.nwo *troclyac
.3480373B1.mu.elspru.nwo Can have a look at SPEL's core-language, and maybe even learn some TroshLyash at http://wyn.bot.nu/spel/src/vocab/gen/start.html
