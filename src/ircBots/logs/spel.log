.348306BA7.mu.elspru.nwo Currently many potential users don't have #OpenCl hardware or software, so MVP must be lowest-common-denomenator (LCD) compatible, single-processor javascript.
.348307061.mu.elspru.nwo MVP for translations software needs better load time, than currently being offered, which will require a server connection.
.3483070A0.mu.elspru.nwo MVP for programming language will need a single thread virtual machine.
.348307902.mu.elspru.nwo  adding server is easier than making virtual machine, so will start with that.

.34869788B.mu.elspru.nwo ideally will write the book in Lyash variant.
.34869791B.mu.elspru.nwo I'm also hoping on rewriting the Vinaya as I think of it in Lyash
.348698037.mu.elspru.nwo A gender neutral, family compatible, version of the Vinaya
.3486A704B.mu.elspru.nwo SPEL may help with #antiradicalization by making language less of an isolation barrier.
.348789112.mu.elspru.nwo May have to rewrite the irc bots with other libraries, since the node-irc ones  doesn't seem to be possible to stop them from rejoining

.348B80350.mu.elspru_.nwo so I am going to be calling the vocab stable 1.0,  and make a new word-adder, which will add new words ontop of the existing ones, so that the base will stay, and new words will be added ontop.
.348B83224.mu.elspru.nwo I'll be stabilizing the vocab soon, and making translations to the 24 supported languages
.348B8323B.mu.elspru.nwo I need to add a new script, which will add new words ontop of existing ones, rather than shifting it all around.
.348B8A069.mu.elspru.nwo can probably make flash cards by harvesting images from wikimedia, might need a scrapebot.
.348B91735.mu.elspru.nwo generating word lists, suggests lists, thesaurus, objects in #javascript #scripting #auxlang

.3490141BB.mu.pyic.nwo I think #UNL core vocab is very odd, like "lime tree" is core :-|
.349014257.mu.pyic.nwo I've had to delete #unl relations and attributes, as they conflict with international glossing standards
.349014411.mu.pyic.nwo I'm deleting all #UNL dictionaries and word lists to clean things up
.3490144A2.mu.pyic.nwo #wordnet, #special-english, #oxford-3000, are good quality word lists for #machine_translation
.349015160.mu.pyic.nwo reduced vocab from 4024 words til 2822 words, that's 30% less of "core words" like art-noveau, a type of art that was trendy in the early 1900's.
