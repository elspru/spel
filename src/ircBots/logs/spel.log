4855B11B73 elspru:hello
4855B123A4 elspru:awesome so now with day change it will be possible to make good logs
.4855B16099.mu.elspru.nwoh gotta also make the new stuff
.4855B16653.mu.elspru.nwoh i mean finish with the cases, that will be good
.4855B25A67.mu.elspru.nwoh so rather than making it by date, can do it by word count
.4855B26096.mu.elspru.nwoh something like 720 words.  after that can package it into a blog post.
.4855B26451.mu.elspru.nwoh the title should be about 6 words long, so can make it consist of the most common words which aren't grammar words.
.4855B2662B.mu.elspru.nwoh for english that would be words with a length greater than 3.
.4855B26902.mu.elspru.nwoh or can simply have a blacklist of english grammar words which should not be included.
.4855B26BAB.mu.elspru.nwoh I guess I'll go set that up.
.4855B27868.mu.elspru.nwoh 720 is 12 times 60 btw
.4855B29260.mu.elspru.nwoh javascript is great, works everywhere. web apps, console, even IRC :-D.
.4856179065.mu.elspru.nwoh okay wrote it now gotta test it
.4856179531.mu.elspru.nwoh ideally need a way of testing it seperate from reloading the bot..
4856662233 <elspru> hope this worked
.485666B989.mu.elspru.nwo okay so gotta finish that grammar words length thing
.485666BA22.mu.elspru.nwo and then can work on the bots some more
.3479BB664.mu.elspru.nwo fixed up the seconds
.3479BB688.mu.elspru.nwo now records in duodecimal unix time
.3479BB792.mu.elspru.nwo or rather dozenal
.3479BBA13.mu.elspru.nwo so the idea is the grammar words will have 2 or 3 appended to them, based on if they should be generated in the form of 2 or three letters.
.3479BBA7A.mu.elspru.nwo also there will be a seperate counter for 2 letter words, so that when get to 1/phi count of them will switch over to next alphabet for generating
.3479BBB1A.mu.elspru.nwo most of this will occur in rootWordPhon.js with some editing of the text files to enter the grammar word length information thereafter
.347A06009.mu.elspru.nwo  /names
.347A06978.mu.elspru.nwo added password check to bots so can upload source code
.347A06998.mu.elspru.nwo might do it some other way, by simply keeping it in a file outside the actual folder, would be best I think.
.347A069AA.mu.elspru.nwo maybe in /etc/spelbots or something
.347A14791.mu.elspru.nwo  /names
.347A147A9.mu.elspru.nwo seems the bots are now fairly stable
