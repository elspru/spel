    <h1>SPEL Instruction Set Architecture</h1>
<h2>Points of Compatibility</h2>
<p>
CPU's inherenatly are very capable, so don't offer many
limitations to what can be done, so being compatible with them
is easy, though certainly still an important consideration. 
</p>

<p>
Because GPU's currently have the best price to giga-flops ratio, 
(around $0.08 per Gigaflop as of Jan 2015), 
they are the most important type of device to be compatible
with.
</p>
<p>
Wheras GPU's are very fast, FPGA's are very maleable, in fact
the most maleable, so it good to be compatible with them. To
that end, we'll seek SystemC compatibility. 
</p>
<p>
However considering that other important technologies are likely
going to eventually replace GPU's as price performance leaders,
it is good to keep those possiblities in mind. 
</p>
<p>
Quantum Computers is where we are headed, and they offer many
new and wonderful opportunities.  They also have a unique way of
doing computations, which is most easily emulated in current
hardware with reversible circuits. 
</p>
<p>Reversible circuits may be a step that we may experience once
three dimensional processors are commonplace, and before Quantum
Computer are as reversible cirucits can lower the amount of heat
 that is generated.
</p>

<p>Mutation compatability is also important for generating
algorithms automatically. There is a sweet spot between the
simplicity of the language, and the functionality that it gives,
where it is both easy to generate correct programs, and they
have sufficient ability to accomplish a variety of tasks.</p>

<p>Javascript compatability is important because Javascript is
the most portable programming language in the world, as it works
on all devices enabled with a modern web browser.</p>

<h3>CPU Compatability</h3>
Modern CPU's have a wide slew of abilities. 
One underutilized by a majority of programming languages is many
SIMD or vector operations which are provided. 

So certainly have to have support for vector operations. 

<h3>GPU compatability</h3>
Notably OpenCl does not support goto or jump instructions,
thus we are limited to loop instructions for any repetitive
activities. OpenCl also tends to inline all functions as far as
I understand, so there is no call and return which are jump
based. In fact there is no traditional "return" value, as used
in much of functional-paradigm programming, instead some of the
input parameters are written to in order to make output. 

<ul>
<li>64KB consonant memory </li>
<li>32KB working memory per device</li>
<li>32B of registers per compute unit</li>
</ul>

<h4>for SPEL</h4>
<ul>
<li>64KB fits data and complete code size of loaded functions</li>
<li>32KB working memory available for loaded functions</li>
<li>32B is sentence size</li>
</ul>



<h3>memory partition:</h3>
32KB of constant memory for code segment
32KB of shared memory for data and bss

<h3>FPGA and SystemC compatibility</h3>
<p>
One notable limitation of SystemC is a lack of
floating-point-numbers. there are only fixed point numbers
enabled by default, since floating-point-numbers require a large
number of circuits to implement. 

</p><p>
This somewhat opens the door to exploration of various kinds of
partial number representation schemes.  though it is safe to say
that we should stick to unsigned ints as much as possible, with
signed ones possible if necessary. 

</p><p>
Another limitation is that FPGA's don't have true loops, as all
loops are unrolled and inlined. So it is necessary to have a
limited number of iterations for any loop in order to fit on the
hardware. 

</p><p>
Thus while and until loops aren't viable, only for loops, with
well defined iteration and boundaries, so they can be unrolled. 

</p><p>
Somewhat of a feature of FPGA programming is that input and
output are expressely defined. This is similar to human
languages where the dative is the output. 
</p>

<h3>Quantum Computer and Reversible Circuit Compatibility</h3>
<p>
Fredkin and Toffoli gates are universal gates with which all
other gates can be constructed. 

</p><p>
Toffoli Gate is a controlled flip of bits,
and Fredkin Gate is a control switch of bits.
both of them can be supported. 
</p><p>
It may also be possible to in source mark something as
reversible, in which case could arrive at the input based on the
output. 
</p><p>
This may save some hassle as if one writes a reversible encoder,
then it can likely also decode simply by pushing the bits
backwards. 
</p><p>
For implementing reversible computing on a functional level it
is somewhat similar to dataflow programming, in terms that each
function "consumes" the input, however to make it reversible
the output has to have enough information to reverse the
operations. For-example an addition would modify one of the
input values, but leave the other one unmodified, thus making it
possible to "undo" the the addition using subtraction. 
</p>

<h3>Mutation Compatability</h3>
In order to be useable for AI's to easily evolve algorithms as
accomplished by <a
href="http://www.primaryobjects.com/2015/01/05/self-programming-artificial-intelligence-learns-to-use-functions/">Kory
Becker</a> the code at some level has to support mutation. 

For instance in Kory's Brainplus has few opportunities for
parsing errors, so generating proper code is fairly easy. 

The easiest way of demonstrating it, is by showing that
brainplus can be mapped to SPEL.

Those basics will be enough for turing completeness, and maximum
compatability. 

For ease of writing source code can have a call and return, 
knowing that it will be inlined for both GPU's and FPGA's. 

<hr/>
<h3>Basics</h3>
using SSA static-single-assignment

<p>
each warp gets a sentence, or several sentences,
those parts of it which are numbers it can solve immediately, 
those of it which are variables it has to wait on. 
Once a sentence has been solved, and it's SSA output variable 
has been filled by a number, other 
</p>

<p>
for purposes of source-code can use compound words for variable names,
but for bytecode purposes those compounds will be converted to click-words, 
so there will only be a single word per variable. 
There are at least 100's, possibly thousands of SPEL-legal click-words so there should be quite a sufficient amount. though would have to have enough space in order for the full variable to be expressed in the code. 
</p>

<p>
tould also have pointers to the data in the code, though may need something like pointer inactive and pointer active. for instance it could be a variable name when inactive, and a pointer when active.
</p>


<hr/>
<h3>Chapters</h3>
<p>
code segment is a chapter.
The idea is that any output to global memory would occur at the end of the chapter, and any input from global memory would occur at the begining of a chapter. 
</p>

<p>
For instance a Reduce instruction, at the begining each warp may load an appropriate variable from global memory.  But then some of them will have to wait while others compute earlier results. 
Then the final sentence would write the result to global memory. 
</p>

<p>
However in a map operation, each warp would write to their corresponding global memory. So begining and end refering to time rather than place. 
</p>
<p>
In any case the idea is that there should be no cross-chapter references, except via global memory input at start, or global memory output at end.
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Loops</h3>
<p>
traditionally implemented with jumps for control flow. but can do it by using different variables, ones starting with a lateral click "8", are a loop, and once loop is finished they can be replaced with a dental click "!".
</p>
<p>
To show that are within a loop, the initial bit of the index can
be a 0. With the final line of the loop having an initial bit of
1. 
Also for blocks which have no dependancies also have an initial
index bit of 1. 
</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Pointers to Shared Memory:</h3>
<p>
a 16bit pointer could address the whole shared memory space, and
half the constant space. considering some GPU's don't have
constant space, or split constant and shared space, 
it should be sufficient.  CPU's have L1 cache, which is usually
around 32KB nowadays, so having 16bit addressing should be more
than enough.
</p>
<p>
It may actually be best to limit ourselved to only
the first 32KB to fit in the L1 cache, so that would be 16KB of
code or around 512 blocks, with up to 16 instructions per block,
though more realistically 8.  so approximately 4096 instructions
or phrases per chapter, average sentence consists of 3 phrases,
so around a thousand sentences per chapter. 
</p>
<p>
For human reading, a chapter is best kept between the 5 minute
attention span of a toddler and the 20 minute attention span of
a focused adult. Often a rule of thumb used is 10 minutes. 
</p>
<p>
Reading speed for most languages is between 155-213 words per
minute, and there are up to 15 words per block, so a human could
read about 12 blocks a minute, or a 120 blocks in 10 minutes, or
240 blocks in 20 minutes. So would only need 8KB even for a 20
minute chapter. 
</p>
<p>
currently the encoder and it's tests combined come to around 6
thousand words or 31 minute read. though a bunch of those are 
compound names of variables and functions, and there are several
stages in the program. a 16KB code area would allow for 40 
minute chapters if necessary.
</p>
<p>
can have the code held in constant space, allowing for probably even 32KB of code,  and simply have a listing of the variables in the shared memory space.   
</p>
for instance could give a number for the variable, and a length,
could also have a bit index at the start of the code in order to more quickly find where the variable is. 
that way wouldn't have to do search and replace in multiple locations,  once the variable is initialized, it is done. 
there would also have to be a flag to indicate that a variable has been initialized.  
</p>
<p>
Admitedly this kind of system would be harder to debug than the afformentioned one -- and would be less elegant.  However the aforementioned one would require that the sentence have enough space for the whole variable.
</p>
<p>
Also the variable lookup table version would mean the code doesn't get modified,  as modifying the code can be problematic,  though sometimes it is good, such as for reflective metaprogramming.
</p>
<h2>High Level Overview</h2>
There can be different sections or parts to the code:
<dl>
    <dt>Main Thread</dt>
    <dd>the entry and exit point of the program. 
Also where all input and output occurs</dd>
    <dt>Worker Thread</dt>
    <dd>These is for functions optimized to run on other CPU cores.</dd>
    <dt>GPU Thread</dt>
    <dd>This is for functions that are optimized for GPU.
    <dt>FPGA Thread</dt>
    <dd>This optional at this point, but would be for functions
that would be implemented on the FPGA</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Each level has more restrictions than the previous level, so one
of the most restricted level will work on the previous levels.  
</p>
<p>
The main chapter is the only one that will have input and
output.  The compiler will complain if the main chapter is too
large, and suggest making other chapters. 
</p>
<p>
Also each function has limits also. Ideally no function should
comprise no more than 60 rows and 60 columns, with the ideal
being closer to 56 on both counts,  as that is the most stable
isotope of iron, and also how many lines fit on a page, and how
many characters per line is conducive to quickest reading. So
that a maximum of about 52 blocks per function, though SPEL is
highly compressed language, so can round down to 48 blocks,
-- which is an even number in dozenal and hexadecimal -- and
probably would still have slightly more words than would fit on
a piece of paper when translated to just about any language
other than SPEL's interlingua. 
</p>
<p>
considering that can fit at least 10 functions or pages in a
chapter. 
</p>

<h2>Error Reporting</h2>
<p>
Since except for the main chapter, there is no input or output,
there has to be a different way of reporting errors and making
assertions. One way, so to have an output variable which will
take any error messages, similar to an stderr.  These could be
channeled up like exceptions until they reach the main chapter. 
</p><p>
Exceptions are thrown using apprehensive-mood.
try is deliberative-mood.
and catch is hypothetical-mood. 
</p><p>
Error reporting in this way does have some overhead, so it may
be possible to turn off, like assertions, at least for
production code. 
</p><p>
Also unlike exceptions, it will probably take a bit longer to
propogate to the main thread, as there would be a check
installed at each output of a function, to see if it has
produced an error, if so, then the function itself will exit,
forwarding the error, until it is caught somewhere up the stack.

<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p>
The quote is probably the most complicated part of the encoding. 
It is best for it to come at the begining of the phrase, that
way can know how long the rest of it is, and load it all up,
before assigning it to a register designated by the case.
</p><p>
The quote starts with the Quote Flag, which is 30. which takes
up 5 bits. The following 3 bits gives the length.
<ol start="0">
<li>unsigned 8 bit quote</li>
<li>signed 8 bit quote</li>
<li>pointer</li>
<li>16 bit quote</li>
<li>32 bit quote</li>
<li>64 bit quote</li>
<li>128 bit quote</li>
<li>256 bit quote</li>
</ol>
The next 8 bits are either the 8 bit quote, or they provide more
type information. The first bit shows weather it is constant data,
or is a pointer to the data, the remaining 7 bits are type
information.
<ol start="0">
<li>constant</li>
<li>pointer</li>
</ol>
<ol start="0">
<li>constant</li>
<li>constant</li>
<li>constant</li>

<li>ASCII</li>
<li>UTF-8</li>
<li>UTF-16</li>
<li>UTF-32</li>
<li>SPEL encoding</li>
</ol>

<h2>Internationalization</h2>
<p>
Probably one of the main points of this programming language is
that can write a program in one language, and it becomes
available in all other languages. 
</p><p>
Taking the example of gettext, simply by having a different kind
of quote, such as one that quotes legal SPEL utterances can be
translated automatically based on locality.
